Could you provide more context about where this statement appears, or let me know if you have the relevant course material?",
    "bm25_rag": "# Why NANDA Needs Universities, Not Just Companies\n\nBased on Raskar's statements, there are several key reasons:\n\n## 1. **Maintaining Neutrality and Independence**\nRaskar emphasizes that NANDA requires a **neutrally maintained index**. He explains:\n\n> \"The moment we say it's interop and neutrally maintained index, how do you keep it neutral? So we have about 15 universities top AI universities and faculty and scientists at this 15 organizations working together to maintain this index.\"\n\nHaving universities as stewards helps ensure the platform isn't controlled by any single company's commercial interests.\n\n## 2. **Historical Precedent at MIT**\nRaskar invokes MIT's track record of creating open, inclusive infrastructure:\n\n> \"MIT has a deep history in starting something ambitious but being very open and very inclusive... We are deeply inspired by Tim Berners Lee and the worldwide web consortium right here at MIT.\"\n\nHe references other MIT initiatives like the **Auto-ID Center** (for barcodes and RFID), showing that universities can launch ambitious, open infrastructure projects.\n\n## 3. **Overcoming the \"Cold Start Problem\"**\nRaskar notes that university participation provides momentum:\n\n> \"The fact that 15 top 15 AI universities are already working with us with many companies... hopefully there's good enough momentum here that we can overcome the cold start problem.\"\n\nUniversities lend credibility and collaborative momentum that companies alone might not provide.\n\n**Current Status**: 15 AI universities are already participating in maintaining the NANDA registry, with UCLA specifically mentioned as part of this effort.",

    "tuned_rag": "Based on the provided transcript sources, Ramesh Raskar does **not explicitly address why NANDA needs to involve universities rather than just companies** in the excerpts available here.\n\nWhat the transcripts **do show** is that:\n\n- Raskar frames NANDA as an open, decentralized infrastructure project (analogous to building the internet/worldwide web for AI agents), hosted at **MIT**, where he is a professor and director of the NANDA program.\n- He mentions **fellowships** from companies like **Radius** (offering 10 fellowships, CEO Robert Bench) and **Tresata**, suggesting a model that blends corporate and academic participation.\n- He references MIT's intellectual heritage (e.g., **Marvin Minsky's \"Society of the Mind\"**) to ground the conceptual framework.\n- He references a **nonprofit foundation for the agentic web** and encourages open-source contribution, implying a mission broader than any single company.\n\nThe implicit logic present in the transcripts suggests NANDA is framed as **public infrastructure** (like roads, addresses, credit scores) that shouldn't be controlled by a single company \u2014 but Raskar does not make a direct, explicit argument about **why universities specifically** are necessary.\n\n**Gap:** The specific argument about universities vs. companies may appear in portions of the summit talks not captured in these transcript excerpts."

    "bm25_rag": "# Gigascale Impact in MIT AI Venture Studio\n\nBased on the course materials and instructor commentary, **gigascale impact** refers to AI applications and startups designed to solve massive, world-scale problems that affect billions of people and create transformative value.\n\n## Key Definition\n\nRomesh Raskar, the course instructor, emphasizes that gigascale impact means:\n\n> \"The world GDP is in hundred trillion dollars. But often you will see projects that are very focused on very narrow areas... Who's going to solve agriculture? Who's going to solve health? Who's going to solve transportation? Who's going to solve the return economy? These are massive opportunities.\"\n\n## What It's NOT\n\nThe course explicitly contrasts gigascale impact with incremental improvements:\n- Making product managers \"slightly more efficient\"\n- Getting coders to write code \"more efficiently\"\n- Creating \"ripoffs of Angry Birds\"\n\nThese narrow-scope solutions, while valuable, don't meet the course's core requirement.\n\n## Context Within the Course\n\nRaskar states: **\"It's not enough to rip off Angry Birds \u2014 you got to have impact and that's kind of core to our class.\"**\n\nThe emphasis on gigascale impact shapes the entire MIT AI Venture Studio philosophy:\n- Teams must advance projects into MVP and seed-stage with commercial potential\n- Focus areas include digital health, AI-driven sustainability and mobility, identity and privacy-tech, and decentralized AI\n- The goal is to identify solutions that could serve billions of people, not millions\n\nThis represents a fundamental distinction between the venture studio model (focused on high-impact, deep-tech applications) and traditional entrepreneurship courses.",

In the context of an AI course at MIT Media Lab, this probably relates to designing AI systems with potentially massive societal implications.\n\nHowever, I cannot confirm the specific definition or emphasis within this particular course without access to the actual course materials. I'd recommend:\n1. Checking the course syllabus\n2. Reviewing the course website on MIT's systems\n3.

    "tuned_rag": "## Gigascale Impact in the MIT AI Studio Course\n\nIn the context of this course, **gigascale impact** refers to the requirement that student projects address **massive, world-scale problems** rather than narrow or incremental improvements.\n\n### What It Means\n\nAs explained by course instructor **Romesh** at the Spring 2025 Demo Day, the concept is explicitly contrasted with smaller-scope work:\n\n> *\"How to make product managers slightly more efficient\u2026 how to get coders to write their code more efficiently, which is great as well, but **who's going to solve agriculture? Who's going to solve health? Who's going to solve transportation? Who's going to solve the return economy?** These are massive opportunities.\"*\n\n### How It Is Applied as a Judging Criterion\n\nAt the **Spring 2023 Demo Day**, gigascale impact was listed as one of **three judging criteria**:\n\n1. **Impact** \u2014 \"Is this a gigascale impact?\"\n2. **Uniqueness** \u2014 Are you doing something novel (not another photo-sharing app or hyperlocal delivery)?\n3. **Completeness** \u2014 How thorough is your thinking?\n\nNotably, judges were explicitly told **not** to evaluate financial projections or market size \u2014 the focus was on the *direction and scale of impact*.\n\n### In Practice\n\nTeams like **Health Galaxy** exemplified this by targeting healthcare challenges affecting **600+ million smartphone users in India**, addressing systemic problems at a population scale.\n\nIn short, gigascale impact means solving problems that could affect **hundreds of millions to billions of people**, leveraging the MIT/Harvard ecosystem to tackle humanity's biggest challenges."
