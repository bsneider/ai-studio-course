A more comprehensive comparison across every semester (Spring 2020 through Fall 2025) isn't fully possible from the provided sources, so there may be more dramatic role evolutions not captured here."

Helsink \u2013 Healthcare Developer Data Platform\n- A platform to augment the developer experience for building healthcare applications\n- Focused on providing health data APIs for **early-stage consumer healthcare developers** (startups)\n- Targeted the **$6 billion** consumer digital health developer market\n- Key differentiator: prioritized data availability vs. competitors focused on clinical/physician data\n- Business model: tiered pricing (free/open-source community tier up to premium/customized tier)\n- HIPAA compliance handled at higher pricing tiers\n- Team: **Jessica** (technical lead, computer science/computational biology), **Zeb**, **Alina** (founding/product experience), and a fourth member with background at **AWS** and **Amgen**\n\n### 3. Court \u2013 Privacy-Preserving Randomized Trials Platform\n- Addressed problems with randomized clinical trials: difficulty recruiting diverse samples, dropout, cost of collecting private data\n- Used privacy-tech to solve these issues\n- Market context: clinical trials alone = **$120 billion** market; market research = **$84 billion**\n- Team: **Mohit** (double PhD candidate, statistics and economics, MIT) and **Gary** (PhD student, computer science, Harvard), both former **Meta** employees in integrity/privacy\n\n---\n\n## Fall 2024 Demo Day\n\n### 4. Gulf Medical Records / Continuity of Care Platform (unnamed)\n- Targeted patients in the **Gulf region** (specifically Abu Dhabi) who move between countries and struggle with fragmented medical records in disparate formats and languages\n- Four core features:\n  1. Patients can consolidate their medical history and records\n  2. Enables mobility/portability of records when moving to a target Gulf country\n  3. Patients can answer patient-reported outcome surveys (specific to conditions like **diabetes**)\n  4. Doctors can access full medical history in one place and communicate across hospital systems\n- Built a **value-based healthcare-compliant database** for the Gulf\n- Prior work: collaborated with the **Department of Health in Abu Dhabi**\n- Target customers: patients, hospitals, insurance companies, government mandates\n- Presenters had personally experienced the problem having lived in the Gulf\n\n### 5. Hospital Strategic Planning AI Tool\n- AI tool to assist hospitals with strategic planning and community investment analysis\n- Addressed the regulatory requirement for hospitals to invest in communities\n- Simplified and accelerated analyses typically required for hospital expansions (from one bed to a full department)\n- Targeted analyses under **$5 million** in scope\n\n---\n\n## Spring 2025 Demo Day\n\n### 6.

    "tuned_rag": "## Gigascale Impact in the MIT AI Studio Course\n\nIn the context of this course, **gigascale impact** refers to the requirement that projects address **massive, world-scale problems** rather than narrow or incremental improvements.\n\n### What It Means in Practice\n\nThe course instructors explicitly contrast gigascale impact with smaller-scope work. As course co-instructor **Romesh** explained at the Spring 2025 Demo Day:\n\n> *\"The world GDP is in hundred trillion dollars. But often you will see projects that are very focused on very narrow areas. You know, how to make product managers slightly more efficient. How to get coders to write their code more efficiently \u2014 which is great as well, but **who's going to solve agriculture? Who's going to solve health? Who's going to solve transportation? Who's going to solve the return economy?** These are massive opportunities.\"*\n\n### How It's Used as a Judging Criterion\n\nAt the **Spring 2023 Demo Day**, judges were explicitly instructed to evaluate teams on three factors, with impact being the first:\n\n1. **Impact** \u2014 Is this a *gigascale* impact?\n2. **Uniqueness** \u2014 Are you doing something novel, or just another photo-sharing app or hyperlocal delivery service?\n3. **Completeness** \u2014 How thorough is your thinking?\n\n### Course-Wide Emphasis\n\nThe course consistently focuses on deep technology applications in sectors like **digital health, AI-driven sustainability, mobility, identity/privacy-tech**, and **foundation models** \u2014 all areas with potential to affect billions of people globally.\n\nIn short, gigascale impact means your project should have the potential to meaningfully improve lives at a **billion-person scale**, not just optimize a niche workflow."
