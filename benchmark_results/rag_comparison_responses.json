    "tuned_rag": "Based on the provided context, Raskar doesn't explicitly explain why NANDA needs universities specifically rather than just companies. However, he emphasizes MIT's historical precedent of creating \"open and vibrant\" platforms like the World Wide Web and Auto-ID Center, and notes that having \"15 top AI universities already working with us\" helps \"overcome the cold start problem\" and builds momentum for the open internet of AI. The context suggests universities bring credibility and broad participation to an open, inclusive platform\u2014but it doesn't directly state the reasoning for why universities are essential versus companies alone."

    "tuned_rag": "Based on the course context, \"gigascale impact\" refers to solving massive, world-changing problems rather than narrow, incremental improvements. Instructor Romesh emphasizes that while making product managers slightly more efficient is worthwhile, the course focuses on students tackling enormous opportunities like agriculture, health, transportation, and the circular economy\u2014problems that could meaningfully address portions of the ~$100 trillion global GDP. It's about having ventures with potential for transformational, economy-wide impact rather than just optimizing existing products."
