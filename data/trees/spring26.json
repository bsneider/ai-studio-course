          "text": "Build the agentic futureThis MIT course teaches students to build autonomous AI agents that plan, coordinate, and execute complex workflows across distributed web systems. Students learn agent architectures, inter-agent protocols, web automation frameworks, and methods for decentralized coordination, while mastering AI-native coding and multimodal integration.Through hands-on projects, students build sophisticated agentic applications: from automated workflow orchestration to intelligent web scraping and dynamic API coordination. The course combines solid technical foundations with innovative product development opportunities in this emerging infrastructure layer. Students learn to design AI agents with global impact, validate ideas through AI-assisted research and interviews, and move working prototypes toward market-ready solutions.The course features insights from distributed AI researchers, web platform architects, and technical founders. It culminates with a technical demo day showcasing next-generation agentic web systems.Course pillars1. Innovation (20%): Cultivating a deep understanding of where AI is going to be in 2-3 years or more. Multimodal reasoning, autonomous workflows, personalized agents, robotics, and more.2. Human Centered design and Final Project (30%): Learn how to design innovative AI products that can make a truly global impact, validate ideas with AI-powered outreach and interviews, for compelling market-ready solutions.3. Technical Building (50%): We will teach you about hands-on creation of agentic systems, LLM-based tools, and automated pipelines using the latest AI stacks and frameworks.Follow these steps to register for the course:\n- Step 0:Fill out the Spring 2026 questionnairebefore Sun, Feb 1, 5pm (late submissions reviewed case by case)\n- Step 1: Register for course : For MIT (Link), For Harvard (Link)\n- Step 2:NEWComplete mini courses (Vibe Coding 101 + Agentic AI Module 1), before Wed, Feb 4, 10am (late submissions reviewed case by case)\n- Step 3: We will review new applications in batches on Wednesdays: Jan 28, Feb 4, and Feb 11 (late). We will notify both accepted and rejected students by email. Submitting both forms does not guarantee acceptance due to limited space and high interest in the class.\n- Step 4: If after Feb 11, then completethis reconsideration formand optionally submit Homework 1 (problem statement included in form). After submitting, please let us know so we can review your application if spots open up.\nPre-Course Info Session & Social:Mon, Jan 26 (online), andTue, Feb 3 (in person)\nClass Schedule: Thursdays, 10 AM\u201312 PM, Room E14-633, MIT Media Lab (starting Feb 5)",
