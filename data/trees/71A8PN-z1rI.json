I'm delighted to have co-instructors and Leaders with me in this course myself from ashroskar a professor here at MIT Shaheed Azeem a Serial entrepreneur Dave London uh leader of Link Ventures we have Patricia gelli from Harvard um Habib Hadad from e14 fund and John Werner also from link Ventures and we have been delighted with the engagement with so many mentors and speakers who are CEOs ctOS you know very famous VCS and who are really passionate about how we can use Ai and emerging Technologies to solve you know Global problems so we want to thank you all for being part of this amazing amazing Network um and today we are so let's watch a quick video on uh some of these uh days that we have seen early days so the question there is how do you make two to three billion billion dollars a week for the next 30 Years how amazing\n[2:02] decide that they want to come to this class and that's why the density of company creation and of innovation in this room is like no other place on the planet we're in year 16 or 22 year 22 of web 2. we're early days of web 3. the vector assist about 1000x in a decade does that even sound like it's in the right ball all right so what's the difference between you know what we do here you know in an economic environment with this academic research there's hackathons you know there are contests and then somehow magically we are supposed to cross this this huge Valley and create startups and incubators and non-profits and corporate Ventures and so on and we think there are not enough tools here on campus uh and we think it's probably not the if you want to solve some of the biggest problems some of the complex problems uh in energy in health and transportation in redefining our democracy it's not enough to just say hey teams come and work with us and we'll guide you and help you write better business plans and you know improve the fonts in your slide decks um we have to have a completely new model and that's where the studio model comes in because an innovator may or may not be an entrepreneur on the campus here the people who have some of the best ideas some of the best research may or may not be interested in doing entrepreneurship and that's where this Venture Studio class comes in where our goal is to spot you know real unique problems um and we do that for about four weeks and then probe the solutions for additional few weeks and just to get into this course you know we have you know more than 100 people's apply uh they have to take you know a a a course",

          "text": "[12:09] online just to add perspective you know the the doctor-patient relationship in India is very relationship based versus transactional so as you can see in you know most of our interviews the doctor says do it they'll close their eyes and do it so we we aim to create a dual interface so the patients are going to be the center but we want to make sure that the doctors have the insights as well so that they can keep track of what's going on with their patients uh because right now as Namath can attest to it everybody walks into an appointment with physical records they have like 100 files and doctors don't have time to read or shift through that so they base their judgments on their last report only and that may not be enough in in many cases so really brief like there's no continuity of care so a lot of times you know we would diagnose a patient as appendicitis when they would be an ectopic pregnancy case and you know struggling to survive and just that they didn't have access to the last medical record so it's going to be more of a you know digital Health key kind of a thing [Applause] one two one two three all right we'll do it better on the next one all right hey everyone my name is Mohit and I'm a double PhD candidate in statistics and economics here at MIT and this is Gary who's a PhD student in computer science at Harvard both of us have experience in Tech and fun fact both of us worked in meta and integrity because we deeply care about user privacy and that's precisely we're going to talk about talk about today we're going to talk about privacy in the context of randomized Trials so I don't need to explain what is a randomized trial it's a gold standard to validate the impact of any new drug any marketing campaign Etc but there are a bunch of problems associated to randomized trials for example it's hard to recruit large diverse samples your users can drop out it's expensive to collect private information on your users and you know clinical trials alone account for 120 billion dollar market\n[14:11] and 84 billion dollars are spent on Market Research that does not count you know Academia or other policy valuation okay well it turns out we can solve all these problems and a few more with our solution Court now what is court court is a platform for decentralized and Anonymous randomized trials where businesses can save costs in terms of privacy compliance and users can get compensated for not sharing their data okay so think of web3 meets rcts now to go over an example of how Quark actually works let's say we have a client Starbucks that wants to evaluate the impact of their new campaign bring a mug and get a discount all right so they want to know what's the impact of this campaign on driving foot traffic to their stories what Starbucks will do here is that there will be things that Starbucks can't see whoops things that Starbucks can see and things that Starbucks cannot see so for example Starbucks cannot see the user base in court all right now Starbucks can filter out the kind of users that they want to have participating in the trial with some demographics like age location gender Etc and users that comply with these demographics are invited to participate in the trial okay as soon as they they accept they get compensated with a few tokens and then some of them will be randomly selected to get the voucher and others will randomly get up to sibo and their phones will start pinging their location in a fully private way without sending any information not to Starbucks not to court all right as soon as Starbucks decides to end the trial we're able to aggregate these uh things these location things in a fully Anonymous way okay so Starbucks will be able to see the number of visits for the treatment group and the control group and no one ever sent any individual private information not to Starbucks not to correct so importantly there's no one else doing something like this out there we're not doing Federal learning we're not a web 2 company with like private light guarantees and we can get the same exact result that you would get if you",
