If you're a judge and you know it, please just stand up for a moment. Just stand up. Judges. All right. So, to all the uh groups presenting today, you will not have a range of judges that hit so many experiences, industries, um uh resources that they can bring to bear. Now, some of them this may be the one time you get in front of these people. Some of these beau could become lifelong friends, advisers, co-founders, but we are really proud to assemble this group and they're all going to evaluate you. Um, and and a few will ask questions, but during the demo session, you know, you'll get to know some of these. If if you guys can just wave to our our students, that'll be great. All right. So, so sit down. Thank you for doing that. Um, so this class, uh, Romesh is kind of like the Green Lantern. um he got the ring and he's leading uh uh boldly. Uh this class has a a fine tradition's been going on for a while. Sandy Pentland put it in motion years ago, but Romesh has really taken it to a whole another level and um and uh some know that he's the uh the winner of the Lemlson Prize for Innovation, which is uh like the Nobel Prize for engineering and uh uh as a he's in addition to being a practitioner uh and a researcher, he's a is a leader. Romesh, will you say something about your class? >> Yeah, first of all, everybody, thank you for joining. um uh you know our final presentations of the AI studio uh innovations in AI agents. Um I know the course has been going on for about 25 years and about four years ago we changed the format uh to make it more of a studio uh and not about entrepreneurship. Uh so the focus now is actually even more hands-on building because there's no excuse today uh in AI uh just to be talking about ideas over a semester uh or expectations that everybody actually\n[2:02] has built you know working prototypes and uh and uh you know they're really out there and uh I think everybody's having a lot of fun the students are having a lot of fun. I'm going to invite uh Nikolai who has been co-eing this course with me to just say some opening comments. Yeah, thank you. Uh I don't have any opening comments but uh yeah, welcome uh here. Uh I hope you will enjoy these uh presentations. We have a lot of projects uh 38 uh so we will be fast uh uh but yeah most of the projects uh all of projects are great and built aentic AI uh products and infrastructure uh for the world that is rapidly changing as we see uh and I hope you will enjoy it. Thank you John. >> Okay great. All right. So, um, our second team is from India and Usbekiststan. Two PhDs, one in chemistry, one in ECS, uh, at MIT, but you're not going to hear from them. That's Project R2, not R2-D2. But our first presentation, come on down, is Alpha from, uh, Brazil and China, uh, from Harvard and MIT. Uh, let's hear what these guys have to say. Hello. Sorry. Sorry. Hi guys. Good morning everyone. Thank you for coming. Uh we are solving a real world problem here. Emerging markets especially Brazil investment industry needs disruption. They have a huge problem. Top financial advisors are only limited to ultra high netw worth individuals. there are huge amount of conflict of interest uh there on commission based models and also uh every single small investor pay high advisory fees there. So what we are thinking is like leveraging AI to make it more accessible lowering lowering their costs. Uh we will focus on a",

Uh our platform uh has AI financial advisors uh trained by investment experts, actionable investment recommendations and also a smart market and portfolio updates. So Michelle will walk you guys through the experience. >> So your experience start with this portfolio dashboard where we display informative but not overwhelmed performance uh portfolio breakdowns. You can also easily buy or sell assets and then in the back end our system will automatically adjust your portfolio to keep you perfectly aligned with your long-term goals. Moving from this passive management, notice this pop-up message that will show on top of the screen where we give you informative market insights connecting you directly to the central offer of of um our project. This immersive chatbot session experience with our AI advisor. So we curate this professional but intimate advisor persona based on agentic systems. This agent not only knows about the market investment tricks but most importantly it knows about you your interests preference and goals. So our long-term goal is to bring um financial advising and investment knowledge to everyone. So if you are interested in this scan this QR code and become the first to experience our transformative experience. Thank you. So, um, this was the first one. Sorry. This is what we're going to do. You bet yourself. Uh, let me see. I'm going to have one question and can you have the timer go 30 seconds and a judge can pose it? You are not to answer it, but it's just to show uh the type of question. So, does anyone have a question that they want to pose for this group? All right. Go, Richard. >> Oh, yeah. >> Hey, you're really fascinating, Andy.\n[6:05] I'm curious. Is this just for the Brazilian and emerging markets or this also applies to say the US? >> Okay. So, you're not to answer that. You can follow up afterwards. Walk off the stage. Actually, go this way. Give me the mics. All right. R2-D2. They're not R2-D2. They're R2. Come on down. >> Uh before they start pitching, uh few teams please line up always here. So, if you're pitching like in three, four, four, five teams, please line up so we have a smooth transitions. Hi everyone, I'm Seanu and let's talk about the struggles of experimental researchers. These are scientists you'll find in a clean room, a wet lab or anywhere where the equipment they can break costs more than their salary. >> Our skills are based on hands-on experience. And so when learning a new procedure, we go to veteran labmates or dig through old notes. These notes are often missing everything that we actually need. >> This cost us time, efficiency, reproducibility, and of course, money. To make our lives easier, we are building a multimodal AI lab co-pilot. It can see, it can hear, and it can give you real time feedback. And it does this while tapping into your organization's knowledge base. And as you use it, it grows that knowledge base. This makes us very happy. Let's see it in action. This is not as good as our co-pilot. Hey, can you write down this part? >> So, this is working in real time identifying equipment. >> Thank you. Uh, any idea of this? >> Giving safety feedback. >> Yes. Uh, what is the brand of my computer and describe nodes? What you see? After you've run with the co-pilot, you can upload your video of your experiment and it can give you more in-depth",

Here's a more complicated experiment. multiple steps again measuring out a chemical and many steps later remembering exactly what it measured and how much it measured. We desperately need this as scientists but we believe the opportunity for enterprise multimodal AI experts spans biotech, pharmaceuticals, robotics and much more. If this excites you, let's talk. Thank you. >> Okay, so like we did before, does anyone want to pose a question to this group that you will not get an answer from the stage? Anyone? Buler. Buler. All right, Richard. Two for two. >> I always always have questions. Uh, is the value proposition in safety or is it in helping you sort out the chemical? Like I wasn't I might have missed it at the beginning, so I wasn't sure of what the exact value prop is. And I know I won't get an answer here. So, Greg, all right. So, Joe, go. All right. Next group, come on down. The alpha Geraldine is um from uh Brazil. So we have a pattern Peru and and China and Harvard and uh Sloan uh bust to move that means go. Okay. After seven years in Mckenzie leading digital and operational transformations we are bringing this to higher ed. Most universities still run not automatized processes and there's a big opportunity left in the table. We are focusing on the first three core processes of the overall pipeline. Student acquisition, lead management and admissions. This will not only reduce CAC but also it will increase revenues. Our crew of AI agents discover large data into a learning model to calculate likelihood to apply of each prospect student. Then it recommends personalized outreach sequences to create optimized best next actions on who to contact when\n[10:07] and how. And finally, it evaluates and debates each application devising the overall processes for final human approval. Let me show you a quick demo of what this looks like in practice. Once the program details are entered, our prospect agent uh starts. The dashboard ranks candidates by probability and lets the user move thresholds to adjust and have real-time KPI updates. Uh then we have our agents, the profile analyzer, the data loader and the prospect uh modeler that outputs the detail and lets you uh see everything. Uh the admission dashboard has a very similar agent pipeline that builds upon the candidate blueprint then extract rubric scores and uh shows the detail original. So higher education um industry is huge and with this solution we are not only cutting uh effic inefficiencies but also we are generating a lot of value left in the table. >> We validate the pain points um and the workflow with the mission team and we are now scoping the map in a real admission cycle to prove conversion lifts and faster response time and time saved. Our team combines strategy, AI, engineering and UX and this is the first stage towards an Aenteek University in higher ad. We are early movers and we are looking for partner universities and angel investors. Thank you so much. >> Okay. So um here give the cook to them. All right. Any question or observation? All right. One question is like how do you account for any bias for non-standardized uh students coming in from like unknown universities and you know non-standardized backgrounds >> something great all right yep go that way all right Bellarus in Brazil uh seale and 13 years in construction did you actually move the buildings yourself or you like manage people >> not not all right Ah.",

More than 100 billion dollars are wasted per year on them. And the problem is most acute at the top of the funnel as business development teams have the least transparency on projects. So we provide this transparency with sidescope. We give construction firms early stage project signals, assess and prioritize them and help them win those projects by providing research capabilities from internal and external data. Access to this data provides us intelligence that we intend to use to build in adjacent use cases with an eventual goal of having fully agentic agent-to-ag preconstruction. Everything before boots hit the ground should be done by AI. So this is not working. So on the screen we have a fully version um functional version of sidescope. Um on one side we have the data that is coming from our client and the other side we have the data that is coming from our internal database. When we combine this together, we use agents to calculate and estimate the fit of each of the projects and provide our customers with the best opportunities what they are looking for. We also use agents to estimate the profit margins and also support our clients along the way if they have any questions regarding any specific project. So we start with midsize companies and we have a clear path towards the whole $50 billion opportunity. The good thing for us is that incumbents are ripe for disruption in our industry. We are a bit more concerned about uh early stage\n[14:23] identic startups in adjacent use cases. All of them got funding over the last two months or so. So we have to move fast and that's what we do. Uh we have two design partners and a pipeline of interested partners. We are a team of experienced construction professionals and AI engineers. Pavl Gabriel and Minyang. Happy to stay in touch with you. Thank you. >> Great. Any observations or ahas or questions? Beth. Beth is really smart. Be careful everyone. >> Oh dear.

But from 10 people just one that flight to United State it was me the other failed and the reason is because the standardized test. So the problem with the standardized test is the consultant for the standardized test was expensive and fragmented. The time constraint for test preparation is limited. It's static. Uh the interview cases was same. So whenever they got dynamic question they confused and they couldn't track their progress.

So, uh, Ari, fourth year PhD student in computer science. We are 30. We are six pitches in, 32 more to go. Undergrad. Um, hi, my name is Ari. Hi, my name is Ari and this is Intercom. We're building the easiest to use uh agent or agent coordination platform. So over the past couple months, we've spoken to numerous AI companies and startups, and we noticed that many of\n[18:25] them are integrating multi-agent systems, but they're held back by how slow and complex this entire process is. And most of them end up with one context limited and very difficult to code mega agent because there's really no simple way for agents to coordinate at the moment. And so our solution is an extremely simple orchestration platform for multi- aent systems where agents can communicate and collaborate over a single shared channel that is hosted on an HTTP endpoint. The idea is that developers can build task specific and very simple agents uh and we handle the coordination infrastructure. Awesome. >> And so here's demo. We have the UI and users can register their agent fairly easily along with its capabilities and they can hook up their agent using our SDK. It's only six lines of code. And uh in this demo we have three agents. We have a agent that finds research papers, an agent that tweets and an agent that creates tweets. And so they're very simple agents. We are going to create a demo or a sample request to tweet about agent to agent communication. And so, as you can see, the orchestrator figures out which agents to talk to and they're all communicating fairly quick. And you can monitor what they're talking about to figure out how to solve this uh task. And through this, we're able to execute a fairly complex task using only a couple extremely simple to build agents. And so, over the past year, we've seen that MCP has gained a lot of traction. And now the market is shifting towards A2A through uh agent to agent through like Google's A2A protocol. and manual orchestration tools like NADN. It's a huge market and it's growing by the day, but there's really no clear winner for coordination infrastructure. We we launched a couple weeks ago. We already have 100 plus signups. Uh we signed our first enterprise customer last week and we have two companies piloting our product. We're also currently integrating our protocol into Nanda as we speak. As for our team, I previously founded a code editor startup that had over 200 users and Richie previously scaled and built a community app to 20,000 users. Help us save time for developers. Thank you. So, >> how are you thinking about observability? >> All right, our next team, PhD uh from",

Today we're presenting agent forge which is our approach to red testing AI agents before deployment. The problem comes when development teams only focus on agent functionality and that leaves the system open to targeted attacks. On top of that there is no unified certification approach. So safety checks are left inconsistent and slow. So our solution focuses on our solution focuses on designing um an adversarial testing approach which uh we stressed as the agent uh with high-risk inputs uh to detect those vulnerabilities. >> Yeah. So quick look at the demo. So you just log in with uh GitHub and then you select which branch you want your agent to be tested on. You input all the API keys and then it deploys automatically on a EC2 cloud instance and then it registers with the Nest R registry and then you can run an audit. So here we're showcasing a child safety auditor. After the auditor finishes running, you get a safety score and then it gives you a breakdown of different categories and different violations that it was able to to detect. And then the final feature we want to showcase is public testing where we're able to crowdsource uh agent testing where other users are actually able to attack the agent that you just deployed. And then I'll discuss a little bit about market opportunity. We think whatever websites exist today are going to become agents um in near future. You already see the transformation with chat bots. But today that's the global website base and generally it used to be SSL which used to protect these websites. Agent deployment rate assuming 10 to 15% growth. We have a billion dollar market in next few years. um what our strategic road map is around building the beach head project with child safety to build brand that we can actually solve some real hard problems\n[22:28] then look at specific verticals like retail where we think there's high ROI because most of the companies are trying to build um chat agents around this sale and point of sale events as we create a healthy ROI we'll go into the vertical expansions and we build monitoring around this So yeah, if you have any questions, please feel free to chat. >> Great. All right. Thanks. So um any uh give the clicker any any questions to these guys or uh all right uh Jason? >> Yeah. So look like most of the demo including yours are developing by this like AI web coding tools. So I curious like what what's some unique advantage or character of your team make you competitive in this similly easy web coding process? Thank you. >> Right. Yeah. It's not that I don't think you can answer that. It's just for time. We're not having Thank you. All right. So, um, judges, we have eight presented. We have 30 more to go.

Who found one that they definitely want to follow up with at the demo session which is after? All right. Excellent. Um, I I was just standing with Romesh and I'm going to quote Romesh. said, and they built the whole damn thing for all of these. Like just a few semesters ago, these were PowerPoint slides and people were talking about theoretical things they were going to build. That ain't today. And uh that ain't going to be our next one. Alex and Boris, they both are from Russia. They didn't know each other in Russia. Figure I don't know how that works.

So we built uh a conversational AI agent that intimately knows your store assortment and can give your customers uh a perfect advice. So this is how it works. Um, so customer goes to a camera store. Uh, it goes to the chatbot, asks for a camera for advice, uh, AI thinking, looking through the, um, information on the website, the products, uh, and provides a perfect solution. And, uh, you can either go to the to the product page and see details or you can just go directly to checkout. Um so yeah >> and this is our yeah we are working on interception of e-commerce market 70 trillion dollars and uh and uh um conversational market and we know that 71% of people need advice uh to their uh products. >> Yes. And uh what you just saw it's just the first step. uh we're focusing on the um B2C experience but once we are once we build the infrastructure once we get the feedback from humans uh we are ready to move into the gentic web where um AI agents would be able to buy products and uh auto automatically and communicate with each other with the use of our product.

So, my question here would be, how are you going to figure out who to trust so that you just don't end up with a bunch of content spam? >> So, and to judges, thank you for asking these questions without getting answers. It's a way to give feedback that uh the students are being heard. Um so who has not um uh compiled data on COVID for seven countries that seven countries depended on? All right. Well, one of these two has from Afghanistan. Um so uh and from LA, not from Afghanistan. Uh so uh yeah, Atlas go. >> Awesome. Hi all. We're Atlas, your MRI for organizational behavior and institutional change. We wanted My name is Max. >> My name is Tab. We wanted to ask the question of how do you replicate the magic of Silicon Valley? It's something that people have spent billions on. Uh Russia, Saudi Arabia, I mean even in Wisconsin. It's so funny. How do you replicate this magic, this culture behind it? And it's billions spent and often times little success. We think one of the big reasons for this is that people are looking at the wrong metrics. They're looking at patents created, jobs, VC funding, all of which is useful, but ultimately they're lagging indicators. If you want to understand a culture, you have to look at the culture itself. In order to do that, you have to look at the stories you tell. It's exactly what we do. So, Atlas analyzes a large amount of web data to find narrative patterns in certain areas to show policy makers where innovation culture is showing up before the other metrics do. So, what does this actually mean? Previously, if you were trying to create the next Silicon Valley, you could ask the question of how many startups do we have? But that wouldn't actually be that useful. If you want to make an investment decision, something far more useful would be to understand what epicenters are dictating collective entrepreneurial values. What institutions seem to be driving organizational change? And that's exactly what we do.

Each node can be clicked on to get further information for the sake of of time. Uh we'll skip the demo part of it. Uh and what we have now is basically an MVP and what we're looking for is a pilot partner, a city, foundation or agency that is interested in pushing innovative ecosystems uh and tired of using the old uh hard metrics.

What would uh Wisconsin need to gain the relationship uh capital to become uh another Silicon Valley? >> Thank you. >> Right. So um our next group uh three secondyear students at Harvard C's uh School of Engineering and uh they all met each other there. They're all from China. Uh let's hear what they got. Oh, and we're fourth begun. So we have three fourths more to go. Are you a student who's tired of waiting hours for your ad or Piaza post get answered or uh passing our materials into GPT trying to generate some practice questions or professors going through a wall of post trying to identify where your student actually stuck? Attack is booming but now of the AI tools that teller for your real class materials. That's why we built Open TA grounded citationbacked answers from your class materials with a full oversight and control for the\n[30:33] professors. Our product provides solutions for both the student side and professor side. On the student side, we have LM rag power chatbot that provides course answers with citations. There's also a FAQ page, personalized quiz generation and homework help that provides guidance with guard rules. On the professor side, we have a dashboard with analytics that surface the performance of the whole co cohorts. And lastly, there's AI power similarity question clustering so that the professors can provide canonical questions answers uh to the student side as well. >> In the student console, the chatbot gives cited answers. The daily learning hub designs personalized quizzes to help you digest knowledge and keep track of what you need to improve. The assignment helper provides hints and debugging support for each of the assignment questions without giving away the correct answers. In the professor console, we can view the dashboard, student analytics, and content gaps. You also group similar questions into clusters, allowing professors to create canonical answers. These answers will update instantly on the student side, so professors don't need to repeat themselves. As we can saw in the demo, the Open TA already works end to end, but what truly matters is the quality. First, our triple pipeline generates citationbacked answers. Second, students get personalized guidance rather than shortcuts. Third, instructors get a clear, effortless view of where students are struggling. Looking ahead, we're extending this into a full platform with persistent pipelines, deeper analytics, and multi-core support. We're excited about where this is going and we'd love to hear your feedback. Thank you. >> Any uh observations? Yes, Darl. >> Yeah. Hi, thank you. Um my question is basically I saw the um",

They're living with each other as friends. Uh they neither of them have siblings, so they're like their other brother from another mother, and they're at Harvard Graduate School of Design.

So, we help buildings bring curated activities to residents with a one-click experience. Engagement is becoming essential for retention, but building lack the bandwidth. So we automate the entire experience layer. Today resident feel disconnected. Vendors uh can't access communities and building can scale events because everything is manual. There are no local living ecosystem link into uh between the three. Tau automates a full event workflow connects building and vendors and activates amenities into experience hubs. Our platform creates a self-reinforcing engagement engine. more events, more participation um and stronger community. >> So our system makes it easy for residents to connect with their community and also for building managers to connect or oversee activities. Our agent canvas system that streamlines planning, coordination and activities for a building and also at a reverse workflow. The third party vendor can also reach out the buildings and the building staff can discover those proposals, select what you love and approve with a single tap. Our system makes it simple to turn community ideas into events and experiences residents are truly enjoying. As you can see from this matrix, our agencies significantly reduce the chaos\n[34:37] from the original manual workflow. So we have two team members and let's jump into the demo. So the building manager can find the vendors through our agentic web systems. So this is a demo that show when um you have a you have a event plan in mind and you can uh the agent will help you to search for a lot of vendors that related to you and all you need to do is do one click. So the agent just to review what agent did and the agent will help you to do the email back and forth and also in the process you can compare different vendors um and also accept or decline the the proposals. uh after doing that uh your events the agent will help you to post into the community which all the residents can see and also the agent will help you to organize all the group chats and all the uh afterwards of the events >> and that's it. Thanks. >> Okay. So, anyone want to Okay. Uh >> okay. Just a real quick comment. Uh check out what Kobu Cobu Boston startup is doing. All right, our next uh presenter uh lived in Shenzhen for a while because he was very involved in the EV manufacturing space. Uh he goes to Harvard Business School. He does not know how to use a clicker, but he's getting some help on that. Um and he wants to be a global citizen. He doesn't plan to go back to China and he has a great presentation. Let's hear it. Go. >> Yeah, thank you. I just just learned a new thing here. Uh >> you're global. >> Yeah. Uh hi everyone, my name is Ing. I'm building Connie which is a AI operating system and also intelligent part marketplace for auto parts for auto repair shops. Uh and you know there are 200,000 repair shops running in constant chaos right now in US. So for example",

So they are losing a lot of like potential opportunity to get sales revenue and also they have to once they got the order they have to bounce between four to five different software to get a job done which is inefficient and also they have to pay very high price for the auto parts to because there are lots of middle in the process so which is not so good for them so that's why I want to build converse to help them improve the current situation so on stage one we will build a AI voice agent to help them manage all the customer and do systematic followup to get increase the revenue by maybe 10 or 20%. On stage two, we will connect the workflow directly with the our part marketplace. So with with one click, they can just find the optimal parts to purchase either from third party or from our own private supplier on the platform. Over time, we will integrate all the four to five different software into one AI and native one so that the owner doesn't have to pay over like two $2,000 for the different fragmented software. Um, and the market is huge. There are $100 billion for the marketplace and there are $5 billion for the software market. Uh, and here's how it works. So, you can the AI summarize all the miss call information demands from customer. So you can just create the lead very easily and then you can just using the function of fun parts create code and there you can find all the like players and supplier from third party also our own platform our own supplier. Uh yes so that's basically how it works. Uh so for now uh we have built some initial product we have secured some large manufacturer to be our like uh private supplier and also we have secure dozen of repair shop to do the pilot. Uh and for our team I have six year experience in operation investment in repair in uh e-commerce retail distribution industry. My co-founder is a software engineer in Amazon leading\n[38:37] some agent uh innovation for e-commerce. Yeah. Thank you. Anyone want to make observation? Anyone other than Richard? All right. The PhD student from Matt Ne. What do you got? >> Here you know, >> he's going to make he's going to validate you by saying something profound. >> Uh I I I wonder are you sourcing the parts uh for the repair shops from US suppliers or is there opportunity to source globally? And if so, if there's a way to kind of engineer the routes around the tariff, I'd be f I'd be interested in hearing more. >> So, our next uh you're off. Our next uh speaker married into Israeli Russian family and uh she couldn't get a haircut without going through her mother-in-law, and you'll find out why. From China, from Beijing, uh and at Harvard Graduate School of Education. Let's hear what Ron has to say. Go. >> Okay. So, my mother-in-law is in her 50s and she has been running her at home beauty salon ever since she migrated and I know her and the clients who have followed her for over a decade knows about her. But anybody else who need her actually can't find her. Why? Because the internet has made people like her invisible. They cannot afford $30 per month subscription fee. And then they don't speak fluent English. Most importantly, most of the time when you get your haircut, you want cash. They want cash only at the end, right? So people can people cannot reach her. But she's not alone. In the US alone, there are over half a million individual stylists who suffer just the same like her. So I built an app Glogo for them. For the artisans, sorry for the artisans, uh they can just conversational on board and then they have a booking consolation buffer for for their agent. If when they if one customer consolate on them and then their agent will communicate a discount offer on that time and offer it to someone else. They can they support multi- language and multi- payment system. And for us, it's even easier to use.",

So we have a team and I have a technical co-founder behind she's he's really married into my idea literally she he is my husband. So okay that's that's the team. All right, thank you guys. So, so um our next group Stanford and Mberry Ukraine and Oregon and one was working at Twitch. I won't tell you which one. And the other just uh their product just launched. It's the band connected with the meta uh glasses uh and uh we'll see how that that goes. But let's hear what they have to say. Uh and they're both uh at Harvard uh MBA program and they met there. They didn't know each other before. Bus to move. Hey everyone, I'm Zana. >> I'm Amir. >> And we're building Hopscotch. The primary investment in Silicon Valley right now is going into what I would call search and retrieval, content discovery. And the problem with this is that it's attention monetizing by\n[42:40] nature. So, it's designed to suck you in rather than helping you explore content on the web. And it's very helpful for many of the tasks, but we're hunter gatherers by nature. And there's a part of us that wants to go on this co-creation and discovery experience online. So, that's what we built here. Our solution is an agentic visual discovery platform. Think midjourney meets Pinterest. Um it's a rabbit hole for your exploration. Um most importantly, it's sharable and remixable with friends. So let us show you uh here in this demo. Um I'm searching for inspirations for my upcoming trip to Japan. So looking at various Japanese food, Japanese food options, clicking on the website links. uh clicking on similar or different to tune my recommendations. Can also hop back and forth between what I've seen, steer into a different direction, for example, look at various sushi varieties or Japanese tea pairings. Um and then I can also summarize and share this hop exploration uh with my friends. This is a huge market opportunity to collect human- centered data. So there are already some early findings on LLMs actually have brain rot just like uh just like humans and we were interested in both kind of like looking at what the data can be used for for value as well as a subscription based model for content discovery and sharing with friends. Um you know there are some huge players in the space like meta and Google and also Pinterest as a a more moderate comp. In terms of traction we've done dozens of user interviews and there are a few things that stood out to us. uh first discovery and search are distinct uh use case. Um so there's an interest in goal oriented searching and also open-ended exploration. Um the second takeaway is that folks are interested in writing each other's algorithm. So sharing the exploration that they've done online with each other. Um and finally the result quality is paramount. That builds trust with our users and makes the uh exploration path much more interesting. So you can see a screenshot down there",

So, how are you thinking about that aspect of it specifically since you didn't really show that? Because that to me seems like the most sort of forward-looking part of what you're doing. >> Okay, great. Go that way. Um, is Matt Henchin in the room? Matt uh was the traveling chief of staff for Bill Bradley when he he ran for president. He didn't win, right? No, but Matt's a lawyer. These two are lawyers. Here, come come. One from India, one from Nigeria. One was a a beauty queen winner. I'm not going to reveal which one. Uh >> me, >> the beauty queen uh practiced law for 12 years. The other one only nine. Um, but uh they're both at the Kenny School of Government and they have something to say. And you know, I I I'm remiss. You know, you're supposed to acknowledge uh high-ranking officials in the room. Is uh Phil Clay in the room here. Phil, can you just stand up? Yeah. Um one of our judges, don't be intimidated, but he ran the school, the chancellor of MIT for like a long time and did a great job and uh I think the world of of Phil. So, thank you for being a judge. Are you being a tough judge or like an easy judge? Okay. All right. All right. And can I reveal which one was the beauty queen or you want that to be a secret? >> Let them guess. >> All right. We're gonna let you guess. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, our next one. >> Good morning everyone. My name is Cha Wanaka and I'm from Nigeria. >> Uh my name is Prahar and I'm from India. >> Okay. So we're here to present Eval. Most of my life I've spent advising governments as a lawyer um big tech companies and funders. And one of the big challenges I see is gap between the needs of the people on the ground and those who are implementing policies and programs. Be it presidents, city councilors, fund\n[46:43] managers. And with everything going on in the world with all the shifts that are happening, people want to make smarter decisions and they want to put their money in places that most need it. And so this is basically our problem statement. We want to save billions of dollars and we want to impact lives and so I hand over to you to talk about how eval works. >> So we did a quick analysis. We try to delve deeper to understand why this problem was coming out. Primarily the MAB firms are also to be brain but we also understood that a bulk of this problem was coming because countries did not know how to get feedback analyze it better organize it better and a lot of times a lot of data was getting falling through falling through cracks. So we decided we'll build an AI agent which basically helps you gather feedback through a multi- channelannel system. We built a platform which is connected to SMS, WhatsApp, email and a web form. It brings it through NLP powered process where it analyzes all the feedback, puts it through a data analytics pipeline and gives it to the relevant department through a dashboard. Um right now we tested it with a bunch of departments. We are now fine-tuning the prompts and our web forms to anal to to to align it with what uh survey experts typically use. Um but the goal is to make sure that people do not spend a lot of time running feedback processes and gathering this data and they're able to do this more efficiently. >> Yes. So whether you're an international organization, whether you are a fund manager, whether you're a city councelor, or whether you're an investor, you want to make better decisions that are smarter and that are more impactful. And so you should choose Eval, not just like a big lawyer or consultant like we are, use technology. Thank you. >> All right. Anyone want to uh Matt, you you need to say something given that you you practice law and they both practice law. You guys can sue each other. >> Uh be best single use case. So not across",

Even if you don't think so, he might help you. All right. Um next. So, who knows who James T Kirk is? If you know your Star Trek, that happens 250 years from now. Wrath of Khan, the movie, 250 years. Now, it's not true. It's fictional, so it may not happen. But this guy's from Iowa, where James Tk Kirk is from. He's a cardiologist, a doctor, and um and uh studying business at Sloan. Uh let's hear what the cardiologist has to say. >> Hi everyone. Uh I'm Rahul, and we're building trial IQ. We're creating the autonomous voice agents for clinical trials. So, currently clinical trials are a hundred billion dollar industry, but they're fragmented by slow communication involving thousands of phone calls. Trial coordinators make these phone calls every single day, and trials are run on voicemails and phone tag. 80% of clinical trials are behind target because of delays. And one of the contributing factors to delay is the communication mechanisms behind trials which involves these manual phone calls. So we're building voice AI agents for clinical trials and we're starting in cardiology. So our agents can communicate fluently in multiple languages and know what exactly questions to ask from patients and trials. They can provide information about the trial, uh, remind patients about appointments, check in on how they're doing, and monitor for any safety concerns in the trial. I'm going to share with you a, um, demo here, and I'll, uh, ask the, uh, team in the back to just start our video in the corner here. >> Hello. >> Hello. My name is Ben and I'm an AI agent calling on behalf of Brigham and Women's Hospital Clinical Trial Center. Is this a rash? >> Yeah, it is me. >> Is this a good time to chat briefly\n[50:47] about your recent missed appointment with the trial follow-up group? >> Yeah, it is a good time. We can chat. >> Thank you. I appreciate that. Can you tell me a little bit about why you missed your recent appointment? >> And as you can see from the system, it can be tailored to the individual clinical trial, but it also has built-in safety mechanisms, so it always escalates to humans when necessary. My co-founder and I are a team from Harvard and MIT and uh we've already built a prototype and we're looking for further partnerships for a pilot program. We have our first uh in uh potential that's going to start in 2026. Uh feel free to reach out with any questions after. Thank you. >> Right. Well done. Um and I have a special guest on the phone for a second. All right. Anyone want to make a profoundation? Right. The profound observation will come from my guest. Who knows what Amazon Prime is? Who's used Amazon Prime? Well, this next guest on the phone is 18-year board member of Amazon. They're like five people and he's the one who said, \"Let's call it Prime.\" So, if you resent Prime or glad you could congratulate him or thank him. He also created Electronic Arts and I think they have a character in the TV show Silicon Valley based on him. But Bing Gordon, who's a longtime partner at Kleiner Perkins, we're at demo day. I know you've helped with this class. I'm sorry you're not here. There are 40 judges and about 150 people in the room and we've just heard our 17th pitch. We have 17 more to go. Will you just say something profound to this group? >> Oh yeah. the the be the best thing in the world is to uh deal with mother nature as a founder as opposed to dealing with grown-ups and judges and people and teachers. So, uh hopefully your judges can give you feedback that help you beat the mother nature of the real world and customers. >> Yeah. Uh that I'm not going to drop the",

The biggest insight so far is that AI is like a 10 to 100x multiplier for great thinkers and great engineers and uh it's kind of a pain in the ass for um uh civilians so far.

Um I know you do a a poem for all your friends for the holidays. Are you going to have Chat GPT do that or are you going to do all like 250 poems yourself this year? >> No, I can I can still uh I can still crush GPT and on and poetry. >> Okay. All right. Word. I'll call you back when there's a break, but thank you for letting me put you on the spot. All right. So, this is kind of comedy. We're at the halfway point, but we're not going to give you a short break because your form goes up to 19. So, we're going to do up to 19, a little over halfway, and then we're going to collect the forms.

Our next group, so millennials and Gen Z, you'll have no idea what I'm talking about, but there was a TV show called New Heart, and a guy came in said, \"This is my brother, Daryl, and this is my other brother, Daryl. They both have the same initials, AG and AG. Uh, one's from Austin, Texas, the other's from um, uh, UNCC. One went to Princeton, one went to Chicago. I find Princeton people always wear orange, but I guess that's not orange. Um, all right, let's hear what they got. Go. >> So, it's 2025 and we still use things like this. We use uh when to meet and we are sending endless when are you free texts and even with tools like Zapier\n[58:49] Calendarly uh scheduling with others is a huge friction point and you know we are MBA students we go to camp the same campus every day and still MBA students spend weeks chasing each other down to book 30 minutes on their calendars and there's no go-to social tool for this our solution is an AI scheduling agent that negotiates on your behalf So just as a little mockup, so you can text the agent what exactly you want to find. You've already synced either your Outlook, your iical, etc. or multiple calendars. And the agent will identify with both parties where the overlapping gaps for availability is. It will then suggest possible options. And when both parties agree to um a time, it will automatically book on their calendars. And then the next um little video will is more of a future vision where this integrates in your group chat and say you have five people who are trying to find a time for dinner together. This will automatically identify and book that time. And so we see scheduling as the wedge and actually group chats and group agents are the next frontier of AI agents. In fact, chat GPT quietly just launched um group chats in various countries. And so we think that once we have once our agent can handle time, the next step is group projects, family coordination, logistics, um and everything else. So our moat is distribution. We'll start where uh scheduling is daily reflex NBA campuses and then we'll expand participle style into social groups and then Slack style into teams and startups spreading from group chats to every chat.

And, um, I wanted to ask to start off, how many of you thinks learning STEM is fun? You can raise your hands. Okay, some of us, some of us are not raising our hands, but that's STEM, right? And you're not alone because 40 to 60% of students nationwide switch from STEM majors due to poor teaching. And um visual tools help with information retention. Uh students are 89% more likely to stay engaged and focused during lessons with visual materials leading to higher persistence in the subject matter. And at UpCurved we believe that education in STEM should be fun and it should be engaging for students. So that's why our product is generating educational content to explain complex concepts. Um so you can see this video. Uh let's see if that click works. >> Introducing up curved. >> So you log in and then you're taken to\n[1:02:50] like a chat interface where you can ask for uh concepts to be so multilingual for global audience. The system has widely varying time scales of response. Um so these were just two examples of like short snippets of videos. The videos are longer but >> in 3D our feasible region is a convex polyhedrin. >> So we support 3D graphs and code snippets as well. Um and you can make it as long or as short as you want just with interest of time. That's what I am including. So yeah um we have quizzes, podcasts and rag to on the back end. Uh so we want to scale um and deploy a live URL um setting up like two different clients for uh business to consumer or business to business for school districts.

We're trying to create FOMO so people follow up at the break. Anyone here? you you just say something fidelity in the house. >> All right. Um thank you so much.

Of course she was uh the daughter of Lord Byron and Mary Shelley. uh created Frankenstein with her father. Um and so these these issues are present with us, right? This same echo of what's good and what's dangerous for humanity, for animals, for like nature, for the world. So I'm really excited for all of the innovations, but especially the social justice and environmental justice and other innovators here. And that's the the reason why is those problems are way harder than doing it with a blinder on. And so I really encourage you to run at that. It's it's you're widening the aperture of solutions and that's what we do. We run at hard problems. So, I'm\n[1:06:52] really proud of everybody for doing this work.

If you want to ask how that's uh played out in the family dynamics, he's right there. And his dad ran John F. Kennedy's campaign and would not have been elected. So, you can get some good gossip.

Um, who here hates design? I freaking hate design. As a developer and as a non-designer, it's really, really hard to vibe code something that has beautiful design. Um, I need my website to look good. I need to build consumer trust, but I don't have time to agonize over design details. I need to go out, talk to customers, build, ship, iterate. So, I built taste buds, which is vibe prototyping, vibe designing that lets you easily compare and explore many design possibilities, starting with landing pages. So, you enter in a single prompt and taste bot spawns dozens of agents with different models, including latest like Gemini 3 Pro and different flavors from clean and minimalistic to playful and experimental. So, it generates dozens of prototypes for you. And as a non-designer, I don't have a clear idea of what design I want. I just need two things. Do my features work? And do they look good? Um, and so you can easily Tinder swipe left, right, uh, to compare and contrast these prototypes. Then once you have a winner, you can easily export it out into lovable if you're a non-technical person or continue building in cursor if you're technical or you can directly edit these prototypes, make tweaks directly within the platform. So why now? Vibe coding",

They are inconsistent and thus come time consuming and we really need a tool to automate this kind of a process. Uh current platforms solve some part of the problem but they all have some drawbacks. Uh Chrome autofield can do some simple HTML labeled fields but only limited to that and real patent based will need you to have time consuming configuration of the regress stuff. uh and simplify is only limited to job complica application and chatbd can like makes you very uh friction workflows of changing tabs between forms and also the chat interface.\n[1:15:30] So I think there will be a market niche to combine the power of AI to the form fielding uh application and to do semantic field matching uh and to do adaptive response writing to release all the power of AI and help you to do time uh save your time when you do the form filling and we've witnessed the evolving capabilities of large models and also we've witnessed the cursor which has validated the human AI co-editing workflows. Uh so I'm presenting formless here. Let's see a demo. Okay, sorry. Uh so here is a Google form and uh uh here you can see my uh extension has recognized all the forms and we can do one click and it will retrieve all the information from memory hub and fill in all the forms here. And if you're uh not good with the answer AI generated, you can do the inline edit to uh give a custom prompt or custom context to rephrase the answer that AI has generated for that form. So we can get tailored to the context in the uh Google forms. It's also support to other kind of like uh ash by stuff.

It's because patients um they can be recruited and at the right time and the right people. So, my name is Maria and I'm the founder of Bios Inc. So we want to solve this problem. Only 5% of eligible patients enroll in trials and that's not because they're unwilling. It's because they can find trials or understand the medical language. At the same time clinical coordinator they screen um people for weeks um who don't qualify. That leads to 55% of delayed trials. And at the same time also 30% of trials fail to even enroll one single patient. And each failure costs over a billion US dollar. So our solution is Biosync. It's a a gentic AI that combines clinical trial matching and micro trials. Here's how it works. Um can we play the video? Okay, perfect. So the user they create an account and afterwards they can search and filter trials and receive an AI generated um match score and afterwards they receive instead of a medical overwhelming text a concise summary the key eligibility criteria and also at the same time they can contact the study coordinator directly. So what we do is we explain clinical trials understand make it understandable and accessible to everyone and also reduce the burden for the sites by pre-screening and connecting them with qualified patients and at the same time biosync guides people who want to improve their health with micro trials. They can run clinical they can run clinical trials called microtrials on their own and and track it over time.

All right, go. >> More than 80% of total internet traffic are videos and we believe most of them are going to be AI generated soon. But we humans humans are weirded out by AI content. And let me explain you why. We have Zenozero paradox. He argues motion cannot exist if an arrow occupies a space equal to itself at every instant of its flight. But modern math debunked it under the assumption that the arrow is continuous. However, when we apply this to AI video, the arrow loses its continuity. And because you have arrow at every instant that goes through diffusion and back and essentially becomes a new arrow and this also breaks the concept of duration, which is how humans experience time. And that's why I had to spend more than $700 and 50 hours of manual work just to make a 45 second sequence for my AI movie research infrastructure research. However, I I wrote down all the problems I had and made video forge. Now I can make a similar sequence for $12 in just 11",

Uh, the point of all that is that you still have the interactive node-based editor that allows you to refine and edit whatever you want.

This is my colleague Joe. And what we're building is agentic systems at civic scale. You see, currently our cities are fragile. Our civic systems run on fragmentation, whether it's infrastructure, utilities, transportation, or mobility and so on and so forth. And that fragmentation is fragility. And so we're building a civic nervous system. One orchestrator, every system connected across MCP A2A and NANDA. You can connect data sets, drones, humanoids, and sensors via one agentic layer. We've modeled this out during a crisis response situation during a hurricane. What typically takes around 2 to three hours with a Gentic systems will be down to as little as 15 to 30 minutes. No more inter interjurisdictional coordination, one agentic layer. The result, faster response and more lives saved. Did you press uh player on the video, please? Thank you.",

Then it draws upon three scenarios. It assesses the current scenario as to how the system is operating, what a scenario would look like with drone enhancements, and then it will also showcase what an agentic layer would look like, which will reduce times to about a minute in a minute and a half. And this is a large market. Over $300 billion dollars in attraction is real. Uh we have 10 US cities on a demo weight list, four letters of intent, uh three agentic audits with DOS, a demo in the UK and a demo in Asia.

Uh ladies and\n[1:27:40] gentlemen, go. >> Okay. Good morning. Uh I'm Stephen and with Amond and Winnie, we've developed AI. It is a human generated name. We are very proud. Uh I was going to start by saying let's get into it, but we've already been into it for the past hour and a half. There are so many exciting AI agents that are being presented today that is just a small part of this larger AI agentic web AI agentic society that is growing and growing. But I think there's a problem for most people who want to engage with it which is which AI agent do I use for a specific task or process or problem? Um I'm a researcher in economics. We call this economic screening in the humanto human world. If you've ever bought a used car, you might also know this as the lemons problem. Um so that's what we're trying to solve. Uh this occurs in kind of three steps. The first is you as the user go to our AI agent and you say I've got the specific task. I've got a specific goal with this task and I have a target audience in mind. And then the AI agent that we've created goes out to the sea of AI agents that exist and tries to find the five AI agents that are the closest match to what you've described. And then it says to those five agents, here is a long list of robust interview questions. Gives it to those five agents. takes the questions back, analyzes the answers to those questions, and gives an aggregate score to then recommend to you which AI agent it thinks you should use. Right now, we're at stage one where we have a very specific use case, and we've tested on a specific group of agents. The next step would be to try to expand to all publicly available agents for the specific use case before then expanding to many different use cases for all publicly available agents. Do you know how? >> Yeah. >> Okay.",

So, when it finds these five agents, it's not just going to recommend which agent, but it's going to show you afterwards how it made the scores so that you can see the difference between the five agents and how it came to the recommendation. Additionally, based on the specific use case, it can actually sometimes help execute parts of what the agents are doing. So it can let one of the agents e execute the task but get that directly to you instead of having to go separately use that agent. >> Yeah. And that's our presentation. >> Can I >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Yeah. So ju just want to add something that uh the final stage is is the difference between for example the the the search engine is that is not just indexing or the the second stage is make a sandbox to test those agent also the last one is that do the complete task for example in this uh demo that you you you watched uh he used a social media as a scenario but at the end you can also directly post it on on your Instagram so it's a it's the difference between uh these. >> Okay, great. So, here for time when you go that way. All right. Um, anyone want to react to that one? Okay, great. >> I think this was an interesting idea and kind of synonymous to having persona. So, would be curious if there is any level of customization that can happen to the existing agents too. >> Great. All right. Our next speaker is from Canada from Vancouver and uh she's all excited uh to present. I asked her if she's nervous and she said yes, but I think she's ready. Go. >> Hello, I'm Jennifer. I am a engineer turned biologist and I present to you Helix Bio, which is a gentic protein design platform. So protein design today\n[1:31:49] is still very challenging. The process is through trial and error is iterative. It's slow. Even state-of-the-art computational tools are pretty hard to use. And so protein design is really important because the engineering and design enables breakthroughs in therapeutics in diagnostics and in research tools. So I present present to you a aentic protein design platform where uh the agent is able to generate sequences score based on state-of-the-art tools and uses context most importantly and rank these top candidates that it generates and we can send them straight to lab testing. Now the solution here is to design proteins that can target other proteins that might cause disease and we can use these to generate binders, inhibitors and detectors. So I'll show you an example use case in the next uh slide. So here okay great it so here I'm selecting the target of what I want to design and then I tell the agent agent what my design will be like. I give it my preference. So for here for example I select this one as my preference. There are many different things that agent generated for you to select for the start of your design uh to and then it will generate the sequences and most importantly it will rank the top candidates for you to send to the lab for the next steps. Now the market opportunity, we're looking at biologics. We're looking at drugs that target PDM biology. And most importantly, we're looking at the emerging market of protein engineering. This will allow us to create better drugs. It will allow us to uh lower the cost of drugs and it will also allow us to uh increase clinical trial success. So together uh me and my uh tech league Shuang, we invite you to build with us. Uh if you uh want to learn more about this project, if you want to contact us, uh scan the QR code or through the email. Thank you.",

And I asked him if I could invade with 300 people and do an AI retreat. Do you remember that? Do >> Yeah. So these three met at the AI retreat. They didn't know each other. And they now have something that they're going to pitch and I just asked them are they just doing it for the grade or are they going to continue right after? And they said damn straight we're continuing. So this is going to be something these are entrepreneurs are going to go through a brick wall to make something happen. Let's see if it's any good. >> Thank you. Hi everyone. We're AP AAI not API. Um that stands for accounts payable intelligence layer for finance team. Accounts payable if you don't know it sits in every organization. It's responsible for paying its suppliers for goods and services procured. >> Large enterprises all over the world receive more than 1 million invoices each year. And this sheer volume, you know, consumes and overwhelms AP teams in these enterprises. and one in five actually triggers an exception and when you I've passed through um some physical invoices and POS to look at you can do a spot and difference this is basically an exception um and AP teams would typically in reality spend a lot of time just to uh coordinate between uh suppliers AP teams procurement teams just to fix and and and validate an invoice and this results in a very high manual processing cost about $10 to $15 per invoice as well or strain supplier relationship when there's a late payment or a delayed shipment. >> That's why we're building APAI. It's an autonomous exception layer that sits on top of your existing ERP procurement communication ticketing systems. It can\n[1:35:51] understand every exception, identify their routes and it can create an resolution path and autonomously act on it. And on top of that is a single command center for the accounts payable teams. Here's a quick demo of our service. So there the core infrastructure lies on a three-step agentic workflow. This is our first one. Our first agent has access to OCR tools and the reasoning abilities to fill out um these line orders. So once it processes you can see uh these line orders are filled out and then we do this once for the PO and then once for the invoice. Um the next step is the second agent which handles the matching algorithm. It has the reasoning abilities and the oversight over a database to basically match and pair these invoice and POS and therefore create diagnosis. So here you can see there's three issues detected as well as the AI reasoning for it. You can have the direct line item comparisons. And then here's where we go to our third step, which is the AI escalation agent. This agent handles the essentially drafting emails, um, summarizing what the issues are. These emails are pulled directly from the papers as well. So, it's completely automated. And yeah, >> this is already a multi-billion dollar market. Every single company in the world needs to pay their suppliers. and they are facing the same issue. Now our differentiated insight is that we want to focus on large enterprises that handle millions of invoices and they are not going to replace their legacy ERP procurement systems and ticketing systems with all the AI native uh accounts payable solutions that you have seen out there but they are still looking for a solution to the exceptions rates that are incredibly high.

Hi everyone, I'm Rebecca Chen from MIT SDM and this is an echo, an AI for deescalating digital discourse. Polarization is an invisible force breaking our digital society. Big platforms driven by profit. They optimized for user engagement. They\n[1:39:53] conducted research finding out that uh engineering outrageous work and they do it by algorithm amplification by creating an echo chambers and manipulating identity polarizer polarizations. So what if we could see the trap before we actually fall into it? I'll directly jump into the demo. So here I'm using a mock web page to simulate a Reddit thread. Um this is a URL I paste and you can see that the context is loaded and on the right hand side there is an echo where it provides the polariz polarization index of 85% and an emotional score with some it insights about how this content is escalating. uh adversaries and for each comment we could also see the insights and suggestions. So I received some pos uh positive reactions and also the request of improving the user experience. So what's next? The most importantly is the mobile integration where an e an an echo could monitor our social media apps. An echo aims to be the counterforce to reclaim the agency of individual users and take back the control of our algorithm for our digital lives. Thank you. >> Okay. Anyone want to res react? Okay.

I'm Raang. >> I'm Enrique. >> And we're building Scout. Scout helps freelancers and SMBs answer inquiries uh qualify leads and book meetings easily. The problem is uh a lot of small medium businesses spend a lot of time uh going back and forth scheduling meetings, answering frequently asked questions and also struggling to negotiate and so on. So we want to make that as easy as possible and remove any friction. So right now even though we're just focusing on uh leads lead qualifying and scheduling we want to be the entry point for SMBs into the uh Aenic web and uh automate most of their workflows. >> So the setup is very easy. You just input your business details, your knowledge base, so information about your business and connect to your calendar and then our our platform deploys an agent publicly that then you can share with people to talk to you. >> So here we see the knowledge base with information about how how to qualify lead uh leads instructions. Then we see the conversation the agent is qualifying the lead and then once it sees a valid customer it suggest to book an appointment. The agent then goes tries to book it and it's going to see that there's no time available, right? So, it suggests alternate times and then it's going to go ahead and then try to book again and we can inspect the conversations. We can see what the the agent is actually doing actively. It's going to go uh spin up a a sandbox uh desktop, log into Calendarly, fill out everything, add information about the conversation, and you can imagine and then confirm to the to the user, right? And you can imagine then running any part any task in parallel like maybe looking at the company's website uh\n[1:43:56] testing their product so so you can ask the agent can ask more relevant questions do while they're in the conversation >> and we're looking to run pilots so if you know a business or looking to do something like this please let us know. >> Thank you. No, nobody. Okay, next group. Come on. Come on down. All right. Both uh ex-military uh Tel Aviv and from Boston from Canton uh but lives in Weston. Uh I don't know if that what that statement makes. Um but uh let's see what they got. Go. >> Okay. Hello everybody. My name is Asaf and this is Josh. And we are building a free agent which is the agent friend that can help you search the web for products. Uh the problem is uh personally it's my uh wife she driving me crazy when she tries to search for things but generally uh there are so many products out there and most of us don't know how to choose so we don't know how have the time or knowledge to search for uh products and in usually it ends with re receiving biased recommendation poor decisions and a waste of time. So we want to consult with others but with whom? So on the one hand we want uh someone that really knows us enough and on the other hand we want uh someone who knows products that are out there and don't have like a conflict interest. So the solution is fragent. agent is like an AI agent ecosystem that can independently act uh and find other agents that are out there that have the most uh and the best uh knowledge and relevant knowledge to help you search for your product. And we can see in the demo uh that we can search like in this demo for a computer then uh",

But the point being on the on the left hand side, just a small fraction of the e-commerce um business would be really significant. On the right hand side, companies are pouring massive amounts of dollars into personalized uh brand ads. So again, a small percentage of that would be would be significant. And then from a traction standpoint, we've successfully done MVP development. We've conducted thorough primary record market research with uh with strong interest. We've successfully been able to integrate into the agentic web uh into NANDA. Um and we've been collaborating with uh MIT faculty who've been supporting kind of this concept of of targeted um targeted branding for for e-commerce. >> Thank you. >> Right.

Uh, like worked on the largest streaming platform in China. Felix is um, uh, from China startup. He sold his company. I asked him, \"Does he have to work again?\" and he said sort of. Um they're both in school now with a new idea. Um and he also worked at Amazon AWS. Let's see if it's any good. Go. >> Hey guys. Um I'm Izzy. >> I'm Felix. >> We're building Perry.AI. So it's the next generation of communication agentic system between content creators and\n[1:48:00] brands. The problem is when I worked in influencer marketing I realized that it's such a manual process like currently it's connected uh by the two ends by agencies which are taking more than 30% of the brand deals. That's also why content creators more than 70% of them actually manage themselves. But that causes problem because they don't have enough time. They have time management issues. And on the brand side, they also hire large team to just do cold reachout which is a very inefficient way of spending their budget. Therefore, we built Perry an agentic communication system between these two ends. So now you don't need to deal with your flooding um inbox of emails from the content creator side and on the brand side you don't need to do code reachout ever again and juggle between these analytical tools. So here we are showing a demo of um brand side inputting a campaign inquiry and it will instantly match you with the content creator needed and also do reach out for you instantly and then the AI is able to negotiate on the content creator side instantly as well. So you just do all of these by a click of a button. >> Right. So market uh by the way it's live it's par-ai check it out market large market we're in a special position because we not only provides autonomous AI workflow but we serve both sides of market so not building a single agent but a agentic web traction uh per is founded a little over a month ago and two weeks in we launched the content creator side of the product and have since then onboarded almost 20 influencers uh accumulating over 50 million followers globally. Right before Thanksgiving, we launched the business side of the product and have since then partnered with a couple great brands such as Wayfair, Beauty Blender. Um, so please run signals and team. I'll just leave the page here in case you want to read it. Um, but it's a beautiful combination of domain expertise and uh engineering execution. So please talk to us if you're interested.

Please raise your hand or was an international student? Yeah, a lot of you. Now, keep your hand up if tax season around March and April stressed you out. Yeah. So international students face a very complicated uh rule system that they don't know uh uh how to navigate the uh US uh tax rules. Um basically existing rules just help them fill the the form. They don't tell them what is wrong, what is right and international student just end up feeling their taxes in the wrong way. And this is exactly why Atlas tax is here. Atlas tax uh is your international uh crossber uh agent. Uh you just upload your W2, your Sprint tax PDF and investment data. The agent will interpret the visa residency and treaty and it will flag missed exemption identified uh refund opportunities and will provide you with a clear uh personalized capital gains uh\n[1:52:02] recommendation. It will provide it in a report that will be easy to read. Let's see a quick demo. So you just upload the files, put your uh investment data, the where you coming from, this is the interpretation, run the agent and you'll get the report what you have to get back. Okay. And the market opportunity is huge. More than 1.1 million international students every year pay between 70 to 150 uh dollars creating 160 uh million uh opportunity and this does not include 700 international workers, global professionals and digital nomads. So Atlas Tax is here to make tax filing from anxiety to clarity. Thank you very much. >> All right, great. Um yep. Uh, anyone want to respond? >> Richard, you haven't gone in a while. >> Yeah.

So, for example, as a grad myself, I receive the same message every day from my PI Tim, what do you have done today? What is the update? And that's the motivation of creating this agentic tool. We call it vestra. And uh we want to automate this process. And we understand there are a lot of similar tools on the market. But there are actually a lot of uh better things that we have done for this tool. So here's just a general architecture of this tool. Uh two critical agents are actually differentiating from other uh product on the market. The first one is on the left is the local agent which can securely access the local files for the context and even suggest for attachments and the second one is the learner agent on the bottom which is actually inspired by this class. So it can actually be another you. It can mimic your tongue. It can know if you get promoted, if you got graduates, you can move from another location to another location. You can learn from the conversation from all the contacts that you sent interact with others. Now let's do a demo. >> So imagine team is very busy doing his research and don't want to talk to anyone. But I'm just being very annoying and bugging him for homework three and want to schedule a meeting. This is Vistra AI. Before it writes a single word, it knows who team is. It knows that Tim is a grad student and it knows exactly how to talk to his professors versus his friends. He can even tune the agents making them precise for research data but relaxed for personal plans. Now let's see it in action. So team has been away from his desk. So he hit sync and instantly BR processed the new email from Caroline. She needs teams homework 3 files and wants to meet. Usually this is headache. While team had to dig file for himself, but look at agent chain below. Restra is already doing it. The local agent scanned team's drive. It ignored the old drafts and found the exact zoline eve\n[1:56:03] 99% relevance. At the same time, the calendar agent found a free slot at 2 p.m. and tentatively blocked it out. And for the big picture, the assistant gives team a summary of conflicts he might have missed. And back in the outbots, the reply is already written, file attached, time confirmed, and team just need to hit set. Our investor AI handles the busy work. So team can focus on the research. >> Thank you. >> So um anyone want to join this team full-time? Okay. Anyone have a question observation? Right. Um here go that way. Yeah. All right. Here come. So, uh, Jane, um, uh, grew up, you know, from Winnipeg, uh, grew up in Paris, um, and, uh, she's part of, she's a CTO of a company that has 300,000 users. Her co-founders are still running it. She's at Harvard Business School. And, uh, yeah, let's hear what she has. >> Thank you. Um, you receive 20, 50, 100 emails a day across five different inboxes. You send 5, 10, 20 emails every day. And you've probably tried one of these inbox tools. Maybe it's superhuman, maybe another. Maybe you've installed some AI enabled plugin for Chrome and you've probably stopped using it. That's what happened for me with superhuman. Downloaded it, thought it was awesome, learned their shortcuts, and then I got worried about user privacy. didn't want to give them access to the whole Easter history of all my inboxes and forgot the shortcuts. So, I stopped using it. And it's a real shame because I send maybe I don't know, I spend an hour every day sending emails and I really need an assistant. Now, maybe some of you, especially in the front, have an executive assistant, but I don't. And that's why I created Danielle.

I said, \"What's a fun fact?\" And they said, \"She's from Singapore.\" Um, there you go. That's the humor. >> All right. Sorry. Hello everyone. We are team Ava. We are building AI speech coach that lets anyone speak freely with real-time therapist style feedback. So, wait, I'm so sorry. So, here's the reality. Um speech therapy works but the system around is failing. Um millions of parents are stuck on the wait list and clinics are overwhelmed and one in\n[2:00:06] fourth childrens having um speech disorder are not able to get access to therapy. It's not because they don't want it, it's because the system can't keep up. So we are trying to build Ava to bridge the gap and Michelle is going to introduce the solution. >> Yeah. So um our solution is pretty straightforward. So one the individual would be visiting their therapist and getting a spe specialized plan and then um from there this would be inputed into our interface and um the user would then be able to interact and be able to um complete the different exercises they have to do um along with um any form of training plans and then our AI analyses will spit out exactly how um the individual can improve upon um their different speech impediments um with real-time feedback as well as um with progress tracking. according to um the different cadence that the therapist actually assigns them to do. So a simple demo um with our interface is shown here. Yeah. Uh can you click it? Yeah. So um what you'll see here is that the user will first be able to select the um type of speech impediment they have and then also the complexity of the plan. Um and then from there the um specific statements will be given out to um them to complete and this is the portion in which the user is speaking into um the interface um for it to record exactly the starter or um the kinds of speech impediments um the individual has and then um yeah from there the um agent will then spit out the um according um improvement tactics. >> Okay, a brief overview of the market opportunities. A key number here we have around 8 million of English speaker who has stuttering or other speech impairment. We could potentially be our users. If we reach a 2% of user conversion rate, that will be 150k of users for our product which we think is possible because AI is seriously underutilized in the speech therapy field.

So um if you know your math, we have completed 1719ths of the presentation. That means we're down to the last three. I'm going to make two observations. I was struck how for many of the teams they had never used this type of clicker or they have never used a clicker before. So, as someone who, you know, I use clickers all the time. I find it kind of interesting that that's the other thing. And then I had another observation um that I forgot. But here, this is our uh we got three final ones. Uh these guys love coffee, so they're doing something about it. And one's in computational, the other's in data uh system science. >> Do we have the clicker? >> We will use it. We will use it. >> Okay. Uh hello everyone. Today we are introducing a AI coffee brewing agent called Daily Drip. And first let's talk about market. So the global coffee industry is a huge market which is more than $200 billion today and it is still growing steadily but all the cafes face the same bottleneck. Consistent coffee quality and brea productivity. Training a barista is expensive. It takes more than $2,000 per person and it will take them more than four weeks before they can work independently. Moreover, the workforce turnover is high. So, cafes end up uh repeating this training cost again and again. Our product will help\n[2:04:07] cafes ramp people up faster, reduce training cost, and standardize the coffee quality. And here's a small uh demo video. Oh, wait. Okay. Can you help me click the video? Yes. >> SP Studio. Here you can generate recipe, brewing recipe for different coffee beans. You can either use the bin from your library or you can manually input all the information. For example, here we generate for the coffee we just added. And also I want to add some customized notes. For example, I want a sweeter cup while clean body. Okay, here's the recipe. As you can see, once the recipe is generated, this is what you see. Um, our visualization agent renders an intuitive second by- second timeline chart. It tells you how much water to add, exactly um when to pour and making sure you hit all the extraction mark in real time. Once you're done, you rate the cup. If you think the brew is slightly too acidic, the system learns from the rating and it will automatically adjust the parameter for your next cup. As the next step, uh we're scaling from team locks to uh community cloud platform launching native mobile apps. This position us strongly for the B2B growth especially in the fast expanding especially coffee market in the Middle East. Join us in making the war brew smarter, track better and savor more. >> Thank you. >> Okay, so anyone want to react? Okay, Gabbok, >> I'd be curious about how you're integrating with the workflow of the barista itself. >> All right, so this is our second last one and that's our final team.

So, right now the investors are overloaded with financial data. And if you go to Chad GBD, let's say, and ask for financial advice, it's going to give you very vague answers. it can hallucinate and uh there's no way to verify uh if you know the sources and the reasoning. So this is where quant comes in. We use real-time data and use rag over verified financial documents to give you real insights and uh we use chat GBD then sorry GBD5 to generate answers based on those uh retrieved evidence. So let me show you how it works. So let's say you want to analyze Google, it will give you real-time data and insights from that um and and metrics. Let's say you can ask it uh financial questions like what are the best performing stocks right now? It will give you comprehensive answers with sources and uh you can even get your daily dose of market news from it. It will give you videos and articles, latest videos and articles from that. Let's see. And then this is my favorite one. You can even ask it personal financial questions like I have $500. What do I do with it? So we have over 50 plus index documents uh and have 25 plus analyzed portfolios. Most of our early users were students who were always eager to use their tuition money for investment and we are going to uh go forward with this uh with pilots with fintech platforms and adding a couple of more features to it. So if you are eager to use your savings, yeah, reach out. >> Give the clicker to the other group. All\n[2:08:10] right. Any observations? Okay, great. >> I think just to think about how you would differentiate with existing financial advisors and um like Robin Hoods like they can just include the AI in their platforms and do the same thing. So how do you differentiate would be something to think about. >> All right. Uh the Pizza's on its way. It'll be over there. I know none of you came just for the pizza, but I want to make sure you know that. Okay. Let's give these guys a round of applause for being the last presentation. Okay.

We are building Rent for me. And it's a pretty simple problem that we all had uh in moving to a large metropolitan area. It was very hard to spend our time when we were at work scrolling through Zillow and trying to find the right apartment for us. Um so we thought this was the perfect moment to try an agent that can do that for us. Um also especially for international renters, Tom's from Poland and meets from Israel, uh moving to a new city was really tricky uh without having someone to do it for you. Um so we've built Rent for Me. >> Yes. And uh the idea is very simple. Uh you enter your preferences, you say where you want to live, what's your budget, and then you go on and live your life. The agent automatically reaches out to brokers on your behalf, books viewings, and potentially even puts in office in your name if it matches um uh the requirements you have set for the flat you're looking for. So basically, it's a very simple five-step process. You log into the site, we get your oath to connect to your calendars. Um, we chat with you a little bit to understand what you're looking for. We review everything. You have a chance to, you know, like change it. If something goes wrong, if the AI hallucinates, everything is fine. You submit it and then the agent just goes around. We have APIs for Zillow and for apartments. We're looking for these things that fits your profile. The agents, you know, corresponds that with",

Yeah, I'm curious uh if we have any plans to in continually engage with the renters that have successfully found their place through your platform because otherwise it's a constant churn for you, right? You always have to be finding leads. >> Okay. So, um we just set a record in 25 years we've never had 38 presentations and part of that is a function of AI that it's such a powerful tool. We didn't encourage the students to go out and find co-founder of their initiatives from outside the class. They all broke up into smaller groups and kind of like what Bing said, they could 10x or a thousandx their capacity with these tools. Uh thank you judges for being part of that. Um what I'd like to do now is invite all the judges up to stand here. I want to document that you are here. Uh unless you're an AI, then stay seated. But if you were really here, we're going to take a group photo here. And as you guys are coming up, I'm gonna ask Nikolai on behalf of Romesh and I and the rest of the the class. Um, and if you're one of the uh mentors or or guest lectures also come up to this group photo. But Nikolai, on behalf of everyone, can you were you underwhelmed by this our students? Were you proud? Uh\n[2:12:11] any um you know Oh, this was my second point of 38 all showed up like nobody chickened out. I mean, that's a good thing, but you know, I was thinking maybe one or two would or or would be late. You know, they claim their dog ate their homework or something, but all we're hearing on time. But, uh, everyone, can you come up and as you're coming up, Nikolai, can you just share as a proud parent what you thought of this class? Yeah, I think it was a great it's it's a great class and I want to say that it was a team effort and I want to thank course team Fredo, Maria, Pumna, Nhil, Romesh of course uh because yeah it was a overwhelming but we are very proud of what happened during this term uh and all the teams that made it to the demo day. Nice. >> Thank you. And any trends you you surprised that students grabbed on to uh that you think are a waste of time? Any things that you think they're precient as to where the world is going? Well, everything is faster now. I think so that trend teams were able I already mentioned it were able to do much more in in less time. So uh and MBAs wrote code and uh CS students uh did interviews. So it's it's very uh multi- um skilled world nowadays will you will you say >> yeah I think I just want to first of all I want to thank everybody like I said everybody uh showed up uh and everybody was here. I also want to thank the Sunday team uh that work with us nearly every Sunday to help the teams build it out and you know many Mondays as well not just Sundays uh work in the evening hacking at this I think it's a real amazing culture uh in Cambridge and I think east coast can show you know how some of the amazing innovations in AI",

I think I would say this kind of the birthplace of the agentic web just as uh you know worldwide web uh has uh birthplace at MIT thanks to Tim Berners Lee and his team. So I think we have something magical happening here. I think you'll remember this moment 30 years from now that uh you know this was the first class first course in the whole world to talk about the agentic web. Um and not only the teams built something in the agentic web uh but in the meantime there's also a sandbox that emerged a lot of them from my own team members uh here at MIT but many of the students and and and teams actually use that sandbox uh to launch it. So it's all happening in real time. We didn't have any of this in August. Um and the world is changing but we are you know I think moving twice as fast as what's happening externally. So I just want to say everybody I'm very very proud of what uh everybody has been able to do and especially want to thank the mentors and guests and reviewers and hackers uh and naysayers who kept us honest uh to get this going. So on to the next >> well and and I would also I think Romesh is on to something. I think higher ed is is going to be um evolving and this kind of model where people are using technology is going to be more and more. I do want to call on two people who are both alumni of the class. Um, you know, he pitched here uh how how long ago? >> Last spring. >> Last spring. And I I think I mentioned I had him do a talk on his idea that's at 140,000 views just on that idea. Uh, and and you're back as a judge. But maybe say what's your observation? Do you wish you were in this cohort and you're jealous? >> That's one way to put it. A lot of a lot of good ideas. Um, things evolve a lot. You know, I think just seeing how the class has transformed just in one semester and all the talent that's performing up here, it's really nice to see these ideas come together and I'm looking forward to uh staying in touch.\n[2:16:14] >> Good to see you back here. >> And then in a second, I'd like all the um 38 team members also to get in a group shot. We have a wine angle, so come up here and then you all are going to set up around the room and judges uh you know, please interact, kick the tires. uh this is this is as special as as what we just went through. >> I did this class almost two years ago and I can say one thing we did not have as many demos as there are today and I have left investment banking to be a founder. So a big thanks to this class because this class gave me the you know the conference to like just go out of my comfort zone. So thank you Romesh >> good to see you back. >> Okay so if you know you presented today get up here >> and you know I see some judges. >> Did you get this picture >> Jenny? Yeah. All right. Well, we'll do one. We have >> stand up a little bit. >> Um, where are the two cameras? Where? I see one. Yeah. Where's the other one? Yeah. >> Just go on the chair, maybe. >> Yeah. Yeah. But he might break the chair and see us. >> We have somebody up there. >> Uh, yeah. May maybe go up there. >> But he's he's on the team. >> No, it's fine. It's wine angle. It's It's good. All right. So, he judges, >> right? And if you were one of the 38, get up here. Except for him. He's taking a picture unless someone else can relieve him. Shant, you want to say something? One of our teammates. >> Thank you for putting me in spotlight, Romesh. Thank you. Didn't expect it. First of all, it's the greatest class in the galaxy, at least on this side of the galaxy. Um, those who are here, consider yourself to be the pioneering uh batch of Agentic Wave, Agentic AI, the first class as I said being taught here. >> Uh, take an opportunity for it. uh that build a company. >> She was over there. >> Go sell it for a billion dollar and come back as an alumni to teach the next class. >> Maria, come through. >> Yeah.
