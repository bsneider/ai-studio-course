[0:00] [Applause] all right everybody Welcome to the demo day for uh uh for foundations of AI Ventures uh this is a course that's been going on for over 20 years um and for the last two or three years we're focusing on uh AI Adventures especially foundations uh of AI Ventures and uh today we are excited to see about 24 teams uh present uh their ideas uh and then soon after we'll have a showcase for for an hour um and uh this is a great class with you know some really you know I'm very thankful for my co-instructors some of the leaders you know uh many of you who have you know been here every day helping the teams many of the mentors and speakers from all over the world who have have come here in person or talked online and our goal is to really break this assumption that an innovator has to be the entrepreneur um and the whole idea behind our studio model is that at places like M and Harvard these two can be different people uh and if you can just do you know uh the right chemistry uh we can make amazing things happen uh and that's the whole idea behind this Venture Studio Clause where we spot brand new problems that are ventur in the a space and figure out how we can build them out um so we also want to thank a lot of the judges uh many in investors last time we collected about $4 billion of AUM uh in this room right now um and thank you all of you for for for being here um and uh also want to thank many of our supporters and uh speakers and so on so let's give a big round of applause for everybody who's participated here also want to thank also want to thank also want to thank uh our St up uh leadership team if they're here um and they have become leaders the Leadership Council uh and that they're helping us here as

[2:00] well in terms of judging um we have conveyed this to judges as well as the teams uh which is we are focusing mainly on is it unique uh is it a demo uh and is it complete uh and the focus is not on Market sizing or quantitative business plan all those things they can learn on a on a on a YouTube video so this is really about you know what we can do at miter Harvard thinking about some of the biggest IDE ideas that are now possible uh because of AI so with that uh we're going to start the final pictures but we have a our um fearless leader Deon Newman the director of MIT media lab thank you thank you hi the highest award teaching in MIT she's a teacher first she's a Apollo Professor that tells you something about you know the how much pride they have for being here she was the number two administrator running NASA for a number of years and she runs the 400 people multiple Labs here M work with she supports Ladi gent thank you thank you John thank all of you for being here um welcome to the media lab if you haven't been here before thank you to all of our judges and for all the students we're going to pitch can you put your hand up shout out shout out they're on the background waiting but uh this is definitely one of my favorite days of the fall semester in the lab because this is how the media lab should be every day you know enjoyed by our industry Partners our startup partners and the highlight of all the students upfront just you know they're going to blow you away because they blow me away every time they get together uh this is an amazing course because of course here housed in the media lab but it goes across campus that's what we're all about we're multitrans disciplinary place we take artists and designers Engineers scientists business folks management you name it because we know those are the teams that are going to lead the world you know in the in the future so this training um this kind of inspiration and excitement and we're

[4:02] also a place uh where you can fail at Nasa I gave a fail smart Award right how many of you are comfortable with failing good this is yeah risky but it's still you know 30% well I'm a trained rocket scientist and engineer so I was not comfortable with failure I just have to tell you but now I can tell the students you know do it here do it in this environment take some risk what's the big bold idea you know it might not work but we're going to get it in the end and um so again just um my thank you for you all being here can't wait for the presentations I get to hear some of them throughout throughout the morning session and we just really appreciate you being here and this is all about the future some of these you know we'll be reading about next year and the year after and uh they're going to hit it back so just remember us when you do come back and visit and all of you visiting today uh we want to make sure that this is you know your home you're you're part of our our extended family and again so just thanks for for being with and and enjoy I'm looking forward to a great day so uh thank you very much here it come to the pitches thank you DEA and you have been an amazing supporter of this whole effort um I think Cann be done anywhere else but at the mighty media lab so we really you know thank you for your support and and and uh and guidance here thank you all the all right so with that this is going to go very very fast we have 24 teams 3 minutes each 1 minute q& a that's 96 minutes and we have only 100 minutes total to finish the whole program so there's no scope for you know a spending time so we want all teams to be lined up your clock will start when the previous team has already left the stage so run up here get going there's a clock here for them counting down to 3 minutes and and judges you'll have just about a minute we will have to cut you off unfortunately at 1 minute so we have enough time uh for everybody um and we want all the teams to line up uh in advance n is uh helping you get set up Talib is going to be your timekeeper Talib is a very famous uh CTO and

[6:03] entrepreneur but today he's in charge of the technology of uh of the timer and so please respect uh when he raises his hands or if he cuts you off as a judge and uh we want to make sure uh everybody keeps moving so you're all excited about listening to 24 pctures all right sounds good great all right our first our first team um from Ghana Sloan fellow and then three Harvard folks ladies and gentlemen fix it AI come on [Applause] down hello okay awesome hi everyone Hi everyone I'm Scala and this is Sophia and we are fixed AI we are putting Appliance Diagnostics and repairs into the hands of homeowners our mission to help you fix issues F catch issues fast and fix them right we are using large language models that help you to um save time money and frustration sorry okay uh a few weeks ago my shower drain stopped working and I couldn't shower and I called the plumber and he told me it was a simple fix and that I could do it myself with the with a drain snake well uh it turned out it wasn't that simple and uh I was worried I didn't know how to use a drain snake and I used our tool to uh let me know that actually was a bigger problem than it seemed and the first plumber was wrong so our tool helped me get gain more confidence and connected me to a second plumber so uh I'm going to walk you how do you go back okay I'm going to walk you through a demo which uh is going to show you how um yeah okay thank you so the demo is going to show you uh a little bit of a walkthrough in this in this demo we have a kettle in which uh in inside of our library we have 25 objects

[8:05] with troubleshooting steps of different uh different objects that are common household objects it walks you through uh different troubleshooting it asks you uh is the cord okay is there something is there rough spots and then it's able to diagnose what your problem is it uses large language models and computer vision to assess the problem with your object right now it's completely working in the back and so we just uh aim to increase the uh object Library uh in the coming uh development and this application can be for the 50 million people for 50 million people with Sophia's problem or the 500 or the 500 million other DIY home repair projects out there which are costing the United States $50 billion annually 75% of the time are things that you and fix AI can handle and fixi isn't just for homeowners we are creating key Partnerships with retail providers Electronics um Brands as well as as warranty providers in order to integrate fix AI seamlessly into all interfaces a man imagine fix AI within every Appliance manual and Retail purchase in order to create a SE end to-end application and this is already happening our competitors are doing this right now the market exists it's just fragmented Home Depot and I fix it some of our competitors are creating these opportunities which are pieces of the puzzle like supporting um retail fixes as well as connecting use to Providers but fix AI is creating an application questions who wants to do a question it's hard can you elaborate you said there was a $50 billion Market uh can you elaborate on what subset of that belongs to you and why yeah so $50 billion worth of the repairs so in terms

[10:07] of Home Appliance systems whether you need to fix your toilet your um as we sell an example your shower head your um toaster these are everyday items that the United States is costing it's costing you people every day about $50 billion to fix themselves or to purchase a new item so that guarant gives us the market to then um support people in their everyday creating those or fixing those appliances themselves and then being connected to Providers to fix them as well are are the appliances companies paying for your business or the customers are paying for the app so we are we have back subscription service that allows for advanced DIYs um repair tutorials that people can join as well as referrals so we're referring you to different partners great all right well done this way go this way go this way yeah um number one number two they both grew up uh driving motorcycles one did it with her grandfather the other did it solo you can guess which one Z academy uh and this is the future of AI as a companion uh let's hear what they have to say yeah green button go hi my name is CH the founder of the academy so I know you are all sick of hearing about the well-being apps what I'm going to show you today is truly different but before that please allow me to introduce this amazing team my name is chenu I have a decade of experience building um software Solutions our health expert Wen from the Harvard trans school public health Tom the psychologist with 20 years of experience the problem we are solving is negative thoughts uh here's a quote from Megan quote we do not realize how how negative and critical we are being of ourselves and as a result we continue to cement negative ideas in our minds and so the cycle continues end quote negative thoughts isn't rare as

[12:08] the research has pointed out there's about 12,000 thoughts per day and 80% of them are negative so what do we do to break this cycle of negativity however Business Review has found self-compassion is the solution now we are aware there are plenty of well-being apps in the industry day one come five minut journal High space just name a few but now forget about all of them our vadge is we are the first agentic journaling companion that builds self-compassion and emotional connection with yourself and others here's how that works um two steps approach first step your Journal right you can either type write speak using your native languages this isn't possible 10 years ago step number two we are introducing a unique way to interact with the AI we call that AI cedit is proactive that's where the Innovation comes in let's work through a scenario together imagine I just had a conversation with my manager and then I was told I'm on the PIP performance Improvement program so I panicked my heart is pounding my hands are sweating so I opened up smart journaling app and then I started to journal AI would highlight the parts that are negative automatically proactively and then offer me a different way to see things in the color green as a result I feel so much better and over time my performance improved our short-term vision is to conduct rcts randomized control trials at har and MIT to prove the effectiveness of this approach and our long-term rate is to empower everyone to be the spark you want to see in the world started with self-compassion our website is live please visit z. Academy and scan the QR

[14:09] code to join the beta thank [Music] [Applause] you uh Hey so the question I yes sir yeah okay all right the question I have is uh you know since you're kind of in some sense it feels like if you're countering what the person is writing uh is that a valid approach that is used by human psychologists or is that a new approach that you have measured and found to be working well journaling has been used in uh the CBT the uh the cognitive behavioral therapy so we're adding a to it sorry you followup yeah so what I mean is you know I write in the journal but then you are re editing my thoughts is that proven to be effective okay all right thank you thank you hi do you have uh access to Unique content to build like an application layer on top of these llms uh or is it just a content from the llms 10s so LM is powerful enough but over time that will be become our um mode right with the unique data we can fine tune the large langage model over time but sorry what's that yes we do thank you all right our next presenter is a Triple Threat um just back from cop uh 29 she's very accomplished SLO fellow uh like practice leader at Martin trust Center seral entrepreneur investor ladies and Gentlemen let's is here what Jennifer has to say come on down thanks so much everyone hi I'm here with ecool and we're doing AI powered energy optimization for reducing emissions I'm an exited entrepreneur alongside another ex entrepreneur and someone who is in eecs doing wind forecasting the problem that we're addressing is climate change the fact that I didn't have to start wearing a jacket until today early December that's climate change and it's a result of emissions 62% of which come from energy

[16:10] and that's because 80% of energy is non-renewable like oil and coal we need to add more Renewables like solar and wind but the electrical grid is a huge bottleneck in our journey to do so it actually takes 2 to 8 years to add a solar farm or or wind turbine to the grid and the physical grid infrastructure can't accommodate the increasing demand for energy and adding Renewables plus as we all know electricity is expensive so the solution that we've come up with is to apply recent advances in Ai and machine learning to leverage AI for energy demand management to reduce emissions just as an example imagine 10 cars come home to a neighborhood or a corporation they all plug in at once at 6:00 p.m. this creates what's called a peak load which the grid may not be able to handle but if we apply AI at that site so the cars intelligently charge at different times throughout the night and when everyone wakes up all their cars are charged that minimizes the peak load this is called load shaving or Peak shifting uh sorry load shifting or Peak shaving and this allows to make the grid more stable to be able to add more Renewables we've created a full demo here um and I'm excited to show you it afterwards if you want to come take a look this is the back end this is the energy generation forecast and we're excited that um on the left you can see here this is urot a utility provider's prediction you can see the difference between the lines is quite Stark so they have pretty bad um predictions whereas we have an r squared of 097 which I'm quite excited about and the benefits of being able to apply this methodology are to be able to add more Renewables like like solar and wind to the grid switch to Electric faster reduce emissions and also importantly reduce electricity cost a major priority of Corporations and consumers in terms of traction we've created our initial

[18:10] prototype we've also received funding from MIT sandbox and are part of mit's venture Studio Proto Ventures and we've done customer Discovery our next steps are to raise funding do further customer Discovery and refine our prototype so with that I'd like to thank you for listening invite you to help make our world a better place and please introduce me to any potential customers thank you all right who wants to uh no take who wants to ask a question Mike ask a question he was a Submariner for a nuclear sub can you give another example besides the car charging about how your uh solution would work yes there's lots of applications Beyond car charging I use that because some may not know but EVS actually take as much energy as a typical house draws so it's quite substantial but there's also applications beyond that in terms of applying AI to intelligently manage other appliances whether it's you know fridges uh uh heat and air conditioning or stove tops that sort of thing all right you're Aero Astro and influencer do you have a question Kush K KJ how does this get implemented to the different uh products that you're talking about sorry can you can you clarify the question like how is does it do all the power management Yeah so basically being able to plug in the appliances and connect them with the software which then will act as an energy management to intelligently manage the different levels and loads great we're going to go next okay thank you so much all right uh six people uh four uh MIT to Harvard uh India Indonesia Canada uh China and United States and one PhD uh let's see if they can how awesome they are thank you have you ever opened your Tik Tok or Instagram just to find out you've missed out on an event you would have loved to attend right around the

[20:10] corner from where you live on a night when you weren't even busy anyways well you're not alone over 60% of consumers report having missed out on important events or opportunities despite the fact that they're constantly bombarded by over 4,000 digital ads a day ads mind you which companies are spending billions of dollars theoretically to Target to the just the right person well this Gap is why we've developed my Lantern to invert the quarter trillion dollar American advertising market and put the power back in the hands of consumers our agents are personalized to tirelessly search for the data you need and the information you want while protecting your personal data from large corporations in my Lantern we use Federated AI to make sure that your preferences are tracked and analyzed from your own device we then will train personalized AI agents that will constantly be scouring the internet to find Opportunities just for you these opportunities can even be matched to your calendar and the goal is that you will only hear about the sport events or conventions or even last minute travel deals that you care about finally using generative Ai and our Chrome extension we can replace the flood of irrelevant web ads you get today for opportunities that you will actually be glad to hear about the Technologies needed to achieve this have only been possible in the last couple of months making now a unique opportunity to lead this transformation how is the experience of using my Lantern first you securely store your preferences and you can even connect apps such as Spotify or Google Calendar to help us tailor the best opportunities for you then you can use our app to select a category and find the opportunity in that category that are specifically relevant to you finally to also be relevant of opportunities in a seamless way you can download our Chrome extension which replaces the irrelevant web ads floating the web today with the opportunities that you will love but not only is this the perfect

[22:16] timing and the perfect opportunity but we have the perfect team to realize the full potential of my lantern with six Innovative leaders from across Harvard Stanford and MIT with backgrounds spanning Finance marketing technology and design and past experiences including the development of Cutting Edge AI systems accelerating the the evolution of Technology businesses and even the leadership of global Fortune 500 digital advertising strategy now what we're looking for next are Partners advisers and beta users to become the first of a billion new consumers to take back the power of their data from large corporations with Lantern AI great we got it all right let's do two questions one or two questions someone judges it sounded like the go to market starts with the Chrome extension can you elaborate on okay how does that evolve do you start with the Chrome extension then what happens yeah so we're actually uh developing in parallel the both the Chrome extension and the web app um so that consumers can use whichever one they're more comfortable with one of the early ites we got from our consumer research was there was a very high variability in the willingness of consumers to share their data depending on the environment which it was in and we found that we can very cost-effectively test those different paths at the same time uh as long as we build the same core technology with slight uh modifications on each end okay any other questions great Corell Corell football you have a unique uh complicated team so what's the organizational structure of a team how do you make sure function well um so sorry goast yeah sorry so sh is our CEO uh he really was the first conceptualizer of this idea um each of us slot into one of the functional domains I mentioned Finance marketing design uh or product development within that thank

[24:16] you this is learn Bridge all right learn Bridge uh uh six people four from uh Harvard two from it uh one from Iran one from Syria one from China One from India we got a little bit of everything uh personalized AI let's see what they have to say hey hello everyone we are learn Bridge personalized AI tutor aiming to democratize English language learning English is a gateway to Global opportunities but the challenge is learning English is expensive Solutions are ineffective stressful and limited access to Quality education for all we offer a solution that has personalized learning using AI interactive feedback and gamified experience as a start initial start we start with TOEFL testing evaluating the learner with initial assessment personalized learning progress tracking and simulating a test for them in environment to truly prepare them to succeed now let me show you how it works after the initial assessment the Journey of interactive and real life exercises begin we analyze them and we provide AI feedback and suggestions the feedbacks are going to be colorcoded and we're going to provide things like cultural misunderstandings and the repeated mistake patterns along with the original essay we provide an improved version of their essay with minimal changes so they can compare and learn the feedbacks are going to be provided both in English and in their native language along with accompanying audio we believe that we can make the

[26:20] Journey of learning English less stressful more efficient and more enjoyable unlike others dualingo for example starts it's good for beginners but it lacks depth Gramm cor makes corrections but doesn't teach so we combine the personal personalization with regional customization for the best solution for the learner and our Global Market is expected to reach 70 billion by 2030 and in as an initial Beach head we start with tofl in Japan the Middle East and India and our going strategy to going to Market strategy uh monthly subscription and partnership with institutions and educational institutions and corporations we have conducted focused groups and VC feedback to truly understand and give the best solution anyone can buy we are a team of Harvard and MIT com coming with passionate experience and personalized experience for for this dedicated for this Mission and incredible advisers please join us to democratizing education one learner at a time let's unlock the learning for everyone and give everyone an opportunity to Glo the global opportunity thank you all right question who has a question any anyone question judges there's a question I don't see it how do you see this in a world where most content is going to be AI generated so knowing English isn't like I'm universal translator star Star Trek he says this isn't necessary why are you doing this it's not necessary no no he says in a what go ahead you want to answer I don't understand no it's

[28:21] not I I been I understand where you're going with this I think this is a interesting concern but at the same time think about all the human to human interactions that is enabling us to be here you listening to my talk without having an AI translator me talking to my advisor and you know unlocking research and all that and I think that sometimes can't be you know replaced okay okay thank you thanks all right here go go that way go that way go that go that way go that way go that way go that way go that way so the next two have known each other for seven years are from azab ban she is a student at Stanford in their MBA program she flew in Just For Today the other the alpha is uh in a Sloan fellow he ran a telecom company in aaban so if you're on a phone in Azan maybe he had something to do with it all right let's see what they have to say go AI marketing hi I'm OJ from MIT and to together is Annie from Stanford we building hype AI platform that makes influence and marketing accessible in three easy clicks marketing through influencers can provide highest Roi and is growing at 30% per year but still remains at less than 4% of half trillion dollar digital marketing industry the reason it is still slow manual and inefficient on average it takes five weeks from planning to posting content and most businesses cannot aform time expertise or budget from other side of the funnel 83% of 6 million in influencers with over 50,000 followers do not even commercialize from it platforms like green and affluence handle only influences search missing on key features like AI automated content generation and direct posting our platform combines all three steps of influencer marketing AI matching AI automated content generation and real-time

[30:21] posting this Way businesses get full marketing control by posting their content in minutes instead of weeks while influencers get 32 times more offers hype uh makes AI help businesses to find right influencers generate content with best available tools and posted within influencer profiles all in just three easy clicks I will walk you through a demo imagine Sara Ecommerce CEO who's struggling with low traffic and wants to advertise a Black Friday discount to do that in Step One Sarah orders EI to find influencers in Cambridge and then she chooses influencers based on Metric she likes which takes her to step two where she generates content with ey or just simply uploads her own picture or video if she has one after uploading the picture it it takes her to step three three where influencer approves the content just like an Uber driver accepts the right and in just the moment the content is posted what once took weeks now happens in just three effortless steps together our team brings over 20 years of experience in marketing and platform building so while OJ did influencer marketing campaign as a chief commercial officer at telicom company I was building CRM platforms at IBM and developing plg strategies at BCG so far we talked to 73 businesses in Cambridge and Palo Alto and secure 25 by verion commitments as we will onboard 400 businesses within the first year hype is a scalable product that changes how businesses Market themselves and we make influencer marketing effortless fast and efficient thanks all right yeah a couple questions a lot of the more valuable

[32:24] influencer content that that makes more money requires influencers to make custom content so not content that's been created for them by the company how are you planning on handling that or is that a market you guys aren't interested in um this is less of the market that we're interested in uh however with AI uh what's happening right now is the industry is changing totally for example you don't need a models right now because they're created by AI so practically by the prompt you can generate something that the digital uh agency was working for three months shooting flying the model to some beach and etc etc so practically we will be able to handling this but we are focused more on something that is very rapid and you need it tomorrow all right give him a round of applause um next we have Brenda former apple and McKenzie and student at MIT Sloan thank you he everybody okay so hi everyone I'm Brenda but you can call me Bri like the cheese and I want to kick us off with a tough question um have you ever felt trapped in a relationship that you knew no longer was right for you multiply that feeling by 10 and you might have an idea of how divorce feels like indeed according to darthmouth divorce is the second most trustful event at a person's life so think about this if you do hire a wedd planner to what's supposed to be a one- day joyful event why you have to drag for your divorce alone so not anymore I want to introduce you to Da which is your AI divorce planner coach da helps you with your legal emotional and financial aspects of of divorce giving you support and connecting you with a community of like-minded people who are also going through this so you don't need to do this alone um we start

[34:25] with the documents part so div it streamline it streamlines the process for you and lets you know which are the next steps also follow-ups with your spouse so no longer you need to send angry WhatsApp messages asking for the papers also uh it connects with your lawyer so you can draft the legal papers much more easy uh additionally uh as AI reads your documents it can give you much more tailor advice on what's supposed to be your co-parenting agreement your alimony and even how your budget will look like after no longer you're sharing the bills with your ex spouse and finally we want uh div to be accessible for anybody both men and women so you can tailor your coach to whoever you want him or her to be in that case we want you to have your coach to practice stuff conversations so in this example let's pretend team Paris is my ex-boyfriend and we need to figure out who gets the dog let's see what um the the app would tell me Brenda the dog needs a 4-Hour walk week efficiency is my thing he's better off with me he's [Laughter] not so uh AI companionship is exploding we see this going to be this is already 10 times more engagement versus any other type of AI app that you see here um also divorce is not a niche market it's a loone already 50 billion and if we also could look at the family law business or the AI companionship business which are over 100 billion business in any sense and finally we have a first mover Advantage we see already that we have some um people doing similar to what we're doing but and they are profitable they have they have had very attractive valuations as oh that's it join me

[36:25] yeah um yeah thank you um so uh I have a question how do you make sure that people don't mess up their divorce process even more when they record videos and audios you know that is not used against them so how do you guide them through that process um first we have lawyers in the team uh to make sure that everything we're doing is according to the law and second we don't necessarily need to keep their data or uh their information all right thank you yeah for time all right next coming down they have 50 years of hospitality experience us Latin America and Europe um ladies and gentlemen uh Sloan fellows let's see what they [Music] [Applause] got how are you guys so how are you I'm p Mia I'm an exit entrepreneur and I'm here to introduce you to Pancho a company that is fixing margins for restaurants and Distributors just in the US small and mediumsized restaurants and Distributors have revenues of more than $400 billion dollar and they face a huge leakage program of $60 billion how do we know this my team has lived this problem vividly we have operated more than 16 restaurants and two foottech companies in two different countries and we know exactly what we talking about for restaurants the problem is about Rising prices technology gaps and low buying power for Distributors is about inefficiency order processes low sales and high order returns and that's why we believe the industry is broken the solution welcome to Pancho an AI power Marketplace that streamlines the supply chain for both our Solutions

[38:27] connects negotiates and transacts generating better prices for restaurants and efficiencies for Distributors so how does it work for restaurants first it automates the ordering then by aggregating demand Pancho purchasing agent negotiates directly with Distributors the best prices possible and then its margin Optimizer agent suggests menu price adjustments for for Distributors it reduces order returns by 60% then it put it puts the self steam back in the field instead of taking orders manually finally it optimizes inventory reduces stock outs by demand tracking we'll start simplifying the ordering process restaurant tours will set up the table easily and add their operational preferences by uploading a picture of their shelves Pancho can calculate the inventory levels and tell them what to buy and when even suest menu price adjustments or offer customized help restaurant tours can place their orders through text voice message or by calling just as they do it right now Pancho then steps in doing some smart recommendations negotiating directly with Distributors and making sure they get their orders free of Errors boom everyone margins improved we are targeting 750,000 is small than medium restaurants and more than 14,000 independent Distributors and we will focus on dense cities with high restaurant concentration once more our concept has been validated with more than 25 restaurant interviews and five Distributors are keen on pilots and our approach has been recognized by MIT sandbox fuse and we were finalist in the MIT 100K pach competition Pancho isn't just fixing margins okay

[40:28] time uh let's do a question not a not a question but an announcement can all of you stand under the screen please when presenting you are not coming on my Instagram pictures some of you are getting cut out good question Sol that anyone have a question anyone judges um so my name is Aon Patinkin I uh built and a scaled one of the largest independent Bakery and Cafe chains in New York City called ovenly and I've also consulted with about 15 other restaurants helping them grow their business I've launched a pizza automation franchise and a food food tech company I've launched uh eight Brands eight restaurants and bars in Lima one of the culinary capitals of the world and I have been um I have a strong Finance um experience and I am an exit entrepreneur in technology I'm atina and I worked over 10 years in the food industry in retail in Europe okay so exit that way do you have the [Applause] click all right so we just did our first third of the speakers uh presenters we have two3 to go if your judge to stand up uh and look at the audience I want to make sure the judges AR falling asleep on us okay this is what's between you know evaluating these guys and ladies and uh whatever sit down down all right number nine is a talent play these two people have been to 50 countries one of them's from Argentina the other's from Oman they both at Harvard uh let's see what they got decentralized skill verification and AI job matching hi everyone I'm Kadar this is toas and we are Skilling we're here to help Empower high-tech uh the high-tech Talent Workforce with decentralized skills verification and AI job matching so what's the problem well hiring is hard recruiting is hard right it's a

[42:29] very oversaturated market right now um the global AI recruiting market right now is about 600 million plus and it's growing centralized credentialing very slow very prone to fraud whether you're a job Seeker looking to find you know the right job for you or you're an employer trying to sift through all these boot camps these you know these skills that are coming out of nowhere how do we verify how do we get there um well we do it with Skilling so you know we are this decentralized blockchainbased platform with tailored AI job matching that is focused and our wedge is a Hightech Talent Workforce especially in this growing world of AI uh you know this AI first world as well we want to make sure that job matching and secure verification is very transparent and real time as possible um but why don't we just jump into how it works absolutely I would like to show you a quick demo of our product we build a landing page and we have two different options you can join as a job Seeker so a person that is trying to figure out how to get a job and then as an employer um if you are a job Seeker we want to make it as easy as possible for you to verify your skills so you apply your resume you apply for a skills verification and then in the background we verify your skills and you can move forward to um apply to a job and so you can either apply to a job as you apply to a job in any other job job Marketplace or we have a pro subscription where you can um apply to a job using AI so you can uh skip all those cover letters and things that take a lot of time um to work through and then um yeah so I would like to walk you through some of the benefits uh right now with AI it's very important to showcase the skills that you can actually do because computers can do a lot of stuff for us right and so we want to ensure that people can um verify and showcase um what what their skills actually are and then that also keeps a peace of mind on employers so that they can feel assure that you're hiring someone that actually can do what they say they can do uh why us and why now um

[44:30] as we mentioned AI is booming and we need to uh verify our skills because computers can do a lot of stuff for us and so us we have a lot of EIC skills we have blockchain background and also Ai and machine learning as well as Consulting um this is us we have been to uh different universities we're doing a master's program in Harvard right now and we have been the software engineers in Microsoft and also in the Consulting industry we have three advisers right now super talented and we are looking for three things today we want to partner with schools to um verify the skills of students we want to help students get jobs and also we want to partner with employers who can be on our platform thank you all right question have you looked at the healthc care industry for this uh no we haven't specifically I think right now we're very agnostic on high-tech talent in general but we will be focusing on specific Industries as we you know as we sort of build us out great right exit thank you all right our next group is our next group uh from uh University of Maryland Mount hoolio to Harvard to MIT and they know about silver Tech uh Elder Care who's who's who's going to be old at some point all right let's see what they have to say there's more than 16,000 Elderly Care Facilities in the US and it's a $1.9 trillion industry but there's a looming National crisis 774 facilities have shut down in the last four years and 66% are at risk having encountered a net loss of $2.6 billion dollar a year and there's widening care gaps due to caregiver shortage and caregiver oversight and we're zeroing in on the high resident sh almost half of the residents move out due to preventable hospitalizations and dissatisfaction with Care Quality and

[46:31] here's how we're solving for it so our sensors monitor resident situation constantly for example sleep patterns emotions and eventually a fall in terms of an incidence or even risk of incidents alerts are automatically sent to caregivers through text messages or phone calls We Gather all of this data from our sensors to monitor situation but also to access this easily for caregivers do not miss anything and EV for us to train in even further our algorith do not miss anything and provide even better recommendations such as in this case risk of turn risk of fall and other important statistics as well our solution is to empower facilities to focus on what matters the most first yse AI or facilities will plug in yse a no complicated onboarding process required second y will provide insight that on seniors at risk of churn and these insights will include um actionable items for caregivers to focus on what matters most as a result facilities will experience less move outs and increased Revenue how do we do this through our multimodal sensors that monitors and identifies residents at churn at risk via a fa prediction with a 92% accuracy sensan analysis and activity tracking highlighted as the most common causes of hospitalizations for elderly in addition we provide actionable care recommendations for every resident so that caregivers don't have to think twice about what do we have to do next this all leads to lower avoidable turn higher occupancy and more Revenue we're the first multimodal Ai and varable free tool that's uniquely focused on reducing r Insurance the current Solutions are fragmented focusing either on audio or video or they force facilities to buy expensive Hardware whereas we can seamlessly integrate with most of the devices that these facilities are already using and frankly there's not a lot of competition in the B2B space right now given the

[48:32] demand and we have a full cross functional team to make it happen we work with some of the biggest brands in the in the industry and we know what it takes to like Belfast and deliver and as for traction we're co-designing and testing with long-term care facilities two in Texas and one in India that's serving thousand plus residents we're looking to deploy as early as January our short-term goal is to help facilities is redu resident CH but in the long term we want to be the all-in-one care Ops and Care managements office serving more stakeholders in the ecosystem our population is rapidly aging help us uh transform Elderly Care join us okay that's it question anyone have you thought about the atome care aspect of this as opposed to just the facilities yeah I think we're primarily positioned for the B2B space which is the care facilities long-term care facilities there six ,700 facilities that we allowed yeah right exit that way clicker please right our next group are five mbas second year at Sloan they're not Sloan fellows this isn't a midcareer they are jumping off their NBA program and doing this so you could see if you think that's a good choice uh Korea Taiwan Japan Egypt and Colombia Colombia is the CEO uh real-time speech AI for navigating patient and optimizing operating room utilization let's you're going to see it here first ladies and gentlemen thank you where's a awesome hey everyone uh we are Oto realtime speech for patient navigation and cost Revenue uh revenue cycle management we bring in together an amazing team with well-rounded experiences and Entrepreneurship strategy and Healthcare and myself I've been a CTO for a large medical Diagnostics company and I'm leading the charge with building out the technology product so let's talk about something that's not so fun which is colonoscopies so on average right now if you want to

[50:32] go get a colonoscopy you have to wait over two months and out of all of those cases that are being built out over 10% of them are actually canceled or postponed due to no- shows or undesirable prep this puts a $1.3 billion unearned Revenue burden on the healthcare space and we're here to change that a Tomo navigates patients end to end using our personalized AI agents using text and voice AI now we won't only uh navigate patients through their entire journey we'll also identify when there's a cancellation and because we can see all patients we can use our models to fit in any patient for the earlier appointment for adaptive scheduling so why now though with the recent Advent of realtime AI uh with speech speech to speech language models you can actually have low latency non awkward conversations um and group practices have actually been mostly Consolidated for PE meaning that now with this uh you'll you'll actually be ble to penetrate the market uh very well which is why it's the perfect time to to launch the business so I'll walk you through a demo it's a bit accelerated but you can actually see the full real time demo in the back later oh okay so I guess the audio is off but um the yeah okay there we go anymore would you be able to help me get a different appointment yeah so I think the audio is malfunctioning here a little bit but what's happening is we're able to have non- lag um during the entire conversation it's able to pull in the patient information do validation and once we have a rescheduled appointment and an open slot our predictive model will identify what's a really good candidate and it'll actually place an outbound call so we're already integrated with twio and we can make outbound calls so through this actually um it can also navigate different languages as well to make sure that it's super inclusive for all patients we're starting off with colonoscopies and upper GI endoscopies and as we continue to progress through um uh or Enterprise grade contracts we'll reach the geriatric care Market which is a quar trillion dollar opportunity and we're

[52:32] all aging so we're all going to be using this type of Technology through our hard work uh we've actually developed good traction we have three Pilots secured with leading hospitals across the us and this is going to allow us to not only prove out the technology but also be able to um refine the user experience we're looking to raise on safe and also asking for your connection so if you want to learn more and work with us to build the leading voice repository and remove all friction points from Healthcare connect with us after this event or by scanning the QR code thank you very [Applause] much yeah so colonoscopy seems like a kind of a random procedure no different from any other why start there or is that just an example yeah that's a great question so uh colonoscopies they actually cost a lot of money they're about $3,000 for every missed appointment and it's fairly standardized pathway so it gives us a really lowrisk safe environment to build out the technology and capture so much value back to the clinics on average 450k a year so it gives a easy Sal cycle we build it out and then we go and sell it and expand to other markets all right this next group Palestine Philippines and what's the other field UK Pakistan Pakistan UK and Lebanon Harvard KY school Harvard MBA Harvard health and MIT come on down and this will be our 12 uh presentation so we've halfway begun we're halfway done you can either see that as good or bad ladies and gentlemen uh Health passport a centralizing centralizing records improving care and tracking performance let's see how their performance is hello everyone my name is Alexi Peters and we are Health passport today we're excited to share with you how we're revolutionizing Healthcare delivery across the Gulf region making it seamless and borderless across uh the Gulf region our Harvard and MIT based team of medical doctors gulf-based management consultants and digital

[54:33] Health Engineers makes this team unprecedented with our expertise for this region in the UAE Saudi Arabia and Qatar 60 million expats are driving unprecedented uh demand uh for interoperable health records and governments across the region are mandate mandating value-based Health Care making this transition not just necessary but inevitable hello everyone I'm Dr Muhammad Jawad noon and I will go over the problems we address the fragmentation of expat health records uh poses three critical challenges first expats um have to have these scattered Healthcare Systems um their their records across different countries platforms and hand in form of handwritten notes and informal conversations as well second doctors struggle to um um provide high quality care because of uh inaccessibility to access to the complete patient history and third uh providers they struggle with implementing value-based Healthcare uh because of inaccessibility and lack of interoperable uh platforms I'm Alissa you and our solution aims to offer a One-Stop shop to cater to these three disparate user groups and their respective problems our wedge starts with patients like you and me let's imagine a patient that has chronic arthritis and diabetes and has grown up in Pakistan has moved to Boston for their studies and is moving to the UAE to work first they would be able to upload their medical records in whatever format it exists in whether it's handwritten or electronic epic or cner in whatever language in this case we have English and or do second our AI solution would synthesize this information into one Consolidated format for whatever target language and Target country that they're moving to in the

[56:34] gulf and third patients can readily access this information at their fingertips and be able to answer patient reported outcome surveys unique to the conditions that they have which in this case is diabetes fourth doctors will be able to access this medical history in one place and with the advances in Ai and Integrations with their medical reports essentially have a space where they will be able to talk with other uh Hospital Systems in a way they've never been able to do before in order to be able to provide care continuously and personalized and this is just the beginning with this data Mo that we built we create a database that's compliant with value based Healthcare in the Gulf leave more all right anyone question all right we got thisy who's your Target customer is it the person who's traveling the provider or insurance companies it's all of them um initially we're starting off with our wedge with these patients that face these problems that we've personally faced having lived in the Gulf ourselves and having to essentially consolidate our reports from all these different places in disparate formats and languages um with this data mode we then aim to be able to attract hospitals that we've already worked with in the past having worked with the Department of Health in Abu Dhabi and third being able to then um attract government mandates um will act as Tailwinds in our Direction um and be able to link with insurance companies and hospitals for personalized care okay we're halfway begun Dr aaba uh from teada has my camera and let's see if you could take a good picture when the green light is going it's taking photos so smile no gang signs please uh that was a joke um Minsky and McCarthy 1955 coined the term uh AI Minsky's office was right right over there he did a lot of panels right in this room he's since passed away but you could look at this timeline to realize AI has been around not just this season uh but like 70 years please pass that around we're going to take a

[58:36] two-minute break uh who heard something they thought was interesting so far right who heard saying that you're jealous that you didn't come up with the idea right who who heard saying that you think that they need a lot of help and that you you're the exactor you're you're the one that could make it great all right um for the next yes so stand up get blood circulated we need you sharp for the next uh uh 12 and uh if you want to introduce yourself to whoever's next to you and talk about the ideas yeah rsh is worried everyone's going to leave during this two minutes so yeah don't don't stress rsh out okay let let the wook win this is mean are the people being Subs I it always happens with me any finals at Google time manag is the toughest you got win [Music] yeah yeah

[1:00:39] [Music] yeah okay that was two minutes sit down uh everyone on your mark get set sit down uh you're not doing very good for those who are not sitting down uh you you should be sitting down you're not doing this right okay sit down sit down John Sharp celebrity a shrink for the celebrities I bet you he met with someone you know but he can't tell you today or he's not meeting with them because he's here today all right sit down everyone all right Mike I know you you stood a lot in your submarine days sit down right do they have chairs and submarines yeah yeah they do all right okay next 12 who thinks this group would look good in one of these jackets all right well let's see if they got what it takes uh this group is a little bit unique a state senator from North Carolina flew up while she was repres representing your District very well uh and I don't know if you know there was an election this last year last uh semester um this's a this is a great group I'm excited for you to uh meet them and um AI assists simplifying Health Care regulations like certifications of needs uh we got GSD uh Graduate School of Design we got doctorate we got a lot of great people here let's see what they got okay go hey everybody we are augur Ai and we're working to streamline Healthcare decisions we actually have a use case that can apply to a lot of broad applications from supply chain and others but we decided for this to focus in on Healthcare expansions North of5 to1 million and the reason is because the problem is vast as a legislator I

[1:02:41] have seen how Healthcare expansion is grit locked over $120 billion dollar of Investments go through a regulatory process each year 22 billion are denied and even more are delayed and we're not talking days or month we're talking years and even decades before advancement to care is had and communities can see the benefit and this deeply impacts business's bottom line so we're working to unlock Healthcare expansion through lowering the cost for hospitals and creating predictable demand so they can understand the demand we're also quantifying the impact which is often the biggest barrier to getting their application improved and we run what up analysis so that they can have the confidence confidence and data they need to scale efficient ly I'm going to pass it over to my colleague uh him who will walk through our product overview and show some of the data that we pull in to run through this system yeah absolutely thank you Deandrea so we are going to show a fully functional demo of a hypothetical however real life inspired example where a Massachusetts Hospital wants to open a radiy department the demo is running we can see that we have upload some upload some institutional specific files and state specific files and the two questions we are looking to answer that if we open a radiology department whether certification of needs are needed what is the process and if yes what kind of analysis can help us to get the approval faster um you can see that the uh the results are here as well as you can link to where the results are found and go take a deeper dive now we want to see what the care utilization patterns are just because uh cost effective analysis needs to be run on data which is outside the hospital as well so we just link the math sensus uh website and we can see what the care utilization patterns are how many people are covered what is the paying capacity Etc and this has the capacity to further become more sophisticated in your analysis and so on um this uh whole demo is based on this novel architecture for hyper hyper personalization of search results as

[1:04:43] well as llm based crawler uh this is our fantastic team who helped to build augre during the whole fall and we are happy to take any questions you have and take a deeper dive thank you so much get my mic is this being recorded yeah um so I think I have two questions one is you said you will simplify regulations but what I saw was more compliance with regulations uh did I missed something and yeah go ahead yes we are um helping with the compliance so man managing essentially getting acceptance approval we are not changing the regulations that would be my other job um that one uh the other question out there uh is what is the adjacency because this will have a certain upper ceiling on how much business you can do uh so is there an adjacency where you can expand into absolutely um this expands into nursing but yeah yeah so so there are many areas where Hospital expands um starting from one bet to a whole department but the agency is that hospitals are regulated to invest in communities as well where they need to do certain kind of analysis any kind of strategic planning in the hospital usually not of more than $5 million needs these kind of analysis and this will simplify the process and make it faster for them okay you're done that way thank you all right um my grad AI the AI powered Turbo Tax for graduate applications April 15th but they do taxes around the world um uh MIT Harvard let's see how well they they work together let's see if they could get a jacket go hi everyone I'm Luca I'm a graduate school admissions consultant and I'm here today to introduce my grad Ai and it's the Turbo Tax for graduate school applications which means it will enable students to prepare their own applications with AI driven expertise the current market for graduate school admissions is very inefficient if we consider degrees to be the product students as the buyers schools as the sellers then both parties are currently

[1:06:44] being represented by their respective agents creating middleman in the middle in the and uh we seek to automate the middleman and use AI automations that weren't possible even a few months ago to cut out the middleman and let's show you how uh it works for a typical user don't know if it's going to meet Tony a college student applying to graduate school figuring out the application process choosing programs meeting deadlines and writing essays isn't easy Consultants are too expensive and doing it all alone feels impossible that's where mgr. I comes in Tony starts by using the chatbot to set up his profile sharing details about his background education and goals the platform helps him explore different types of programs that might be a good fit and provides resources to guide his research it creates a personalized timeline for Tony breaking down the steps into manageable tasks and reminding him of deadlines when he's ready to write his essays mad. suggests outlines based on his unique experiences once he's written a draft the platform offers feedack back informed by admissions Consulting expertise finally Tony prepares for interviews with chatbot driven practice sessions helping him feel confident and ready to share a story with mgr. Tony can focus on putting his best foot forward and universities can see the full potential of students like [Music] him okay so currently um I think we're okay so currently uh the market of the US graduate school emissions Consulting uh is uh over three uh it's over 1 billion annually and the universities are spending more than two 100 Millions USD every year on student Recruitment and this budget has doubled since

[1:08:44] 2018 and we uh currently don't have that many competitors that do the exact same thing we have either a freelance editors who don't provide the comprehensive service or traditional ones that cost a lot more we do have a competitor in Canada that has validated the market but they are not AI driven and they are not scalable so that's where we are and we seek to uh collect a fee from students and then also uh work directly with universities we will launch by uh a b2c uh model and then we will eventually use our accumulated data and user base to enter the B2B Market that's [Applause] it yes please so if you find a real Mentor the mentor will give you sort of credibility how do you make sure your customer will believe in the AI uh we're currently already using uh the automations we proposed to use in the eventual product to uh complement our traditional Services because I have a consultancy and I have been doing this for four years and currently my clients have no complaints they know our editors are using Ai and they're satisfied yeah I think our advantage is we have industry experience that from the real education background help the student to help the prove success that will be one of the advantage leveraged by AI Technologies yeah okay okay so you're you're done here you did great go that way go that way all right 82nd Airborne okay let's give him a round of applause for representing thanks um in Sea AI platform connecting Tech transfer um officers with entrepreneurs government

[1:10:45] tech let's see what you got go hey how you doing uh thank you for coming I'm presenting inpa we're trying to revolutionize the technology trans for Market by connecting entrepreneurs Cutting Edge technology to research to funding it goes uh the problem at a macro level is the early stage entrepreneur ecosystem is extremely fragmented it's tough to connect researchers entrepreneurs with technology there's a wealth of Technology located at Tech transfer offices at federal agencies and universities about 95 to 95% 95 to 97% of patents will never get licensed and I believe a percentage of these could be um lastly the government is earmarks about a billion dollar $4 billion dollar in capital to SBS and STS with about billion of that being misallocated and I think some of this technology and researchers could actually be capturing that the micro level no surprise to you 90% of us are going to fail um that number one reason is lack of Demand with the number two being lack of funding I think this is something we could actually improve so we designed in sepa a platform to connect Tech transfer offices to entrepreneurs to researchers to Federal funding opportunities to try to Spur Innovation so let me walk you through a demo if it plays oh we just fixed that all right well I have to oh there we go never mind so say you want to work on a startup you don't know where to start so let's go with I want to build a startup that solv this te big problem let's go Alzheimer's so what you're getting is here all the available technology out there that's open for licensing for you to begin your journey as an entrepreneur so let's just go Stanford they're a pretty good University uh so Stanford buil some technology The Invention to treat brain dysfunction neurogenerative diseases uh cool so that seems like something that we could go license and start a startup behind but how are we going to fund that is the next question so let's go see what funding is out there for stambridge Tech and it looks like there's a couple so start here yeah NIH is funding uh Alzheimer's research so now you have some tech and uh a grant you can go after but I think

[1:12:47] what it'll help is maybe a startup idea so boom taking stamp Tech you now see you can build neuro renew um a startup that goes after solving Alzheimer's leveraging Stamper technology um I think this is a 350k non-dilutive grant it gives you some like tangible next steps to uh to kind of start building your pitch deck yeah cool uh and we launched about a month ago we have a 100 users entrepreneurs um we have three University Tech transfer offices that have opted into our platform and we're actually working on facilitating our first tech licensing deal right now we've done a lot of customer Discovery with tto or to pay is on how many deals we can convert and increase their commercialization um a standard deal for reference is anywhere between 5 to 20K 2 to 8% Equity 2 to 8% royalty and I think we can capture a small piece of that uh we actually just formed our first paying customer Mass challenge um so Revenue came in which is great and we're hoping they can bring 500 users in annually here's the team I'm Nick a dual MBA public policy student uh my CTO software developer first your HPS join Thea question anyone [Applause] all right you got a question yeah were you showing live product there or are you showing a demo that is a demo but the product is live if you go to that website uh yeah okay great so uh excellent here exit stage right can you say 60 seconds to some of the themes that you that we just saw in the first uh 15 um yeah just say all right yeah I got it I got it 60 seconds all right uh I think 60 seconds is appropriate because this semester has been incredibly different from any prior semester first of all many more teams second it's the first time that everybody in the entire class is building on a single technological Revolution every single business plan this semester is AI driven that's never happened before when we started the semester AI could go text to text during the course of the semester you could go text to speech by the end of the semester you can go speech to speech you can actually talk to AI a lot of the

[1:14:48] business plans are pulling in hundreds of thousands of documents and instant mously making them accessible through AI dialogues uh the rate of which you can actually build product during a semester every past semester it started with PowerPoints then it moved to Powerpoints and wireframes then it moved to wireframes and demos but not in actual code this is the first semester where most of the teams are generating production code using AI assistance to build the code and by the end of a semester during a single class they can have a functional commercial product so if you project out to the end of next semester at that rate of acceleration we're going to have entire companies go from I didn't even think of it at the beginning of the semester to it's actually got revenue by the end of the semester that'll be our Target who thinks that's pretty profound what he just said all right you're you're in the room where it happened all right the next team France South Korea Japan Nepal Forest Quant machine learning platform Forme credit ratings and risk-free sustainability let's see if they're worthy of the jacket go hello everyone imagine trying to buy a diamond without ways to verify its quality without any assurance that it's not just a shiny piece of glass companies trying to buy carbon credit are facing this issue because they don't know if they are buying something mitigating the climate action the carbon credit Market is locked in the trust crisis buyers who purchase carbon credit don't know if they are contributing meaningfully to climate action this is where Forest quants ENT in our solution resid in three pillars our machine learning forward res accessment model our insurance back credit and our loss compensation package

[1:16:50] how does it work Forest quand sits at the center of the ecosystem of carbon credit connecting projects uh Builders satisfiers insurers and also credit buyers you will ask me why now well the carbon credit Market is set to reach 1 trillion USD globally according to Bloomberg and the article six of the Paris agreement is now fully operational following the cop 29 so to succeed in this market we are planning to use our unique value uh which is our machine learning technology combined with our inra carbon credit specifically targeting the underserved Market of small and midcap corporations let's see how how first Quan Works uh in backand side we use um the the ml power risk assessment model to gather input data and cluster project by detecting risk factors based on the um the risk assessment we um the carbon um the credit rating system uh evaluate the project on a scale 0 to 10 this part shows you on the front end side uh our client going to log into our platform and browse it to search carbon project after they finding the the project that uh the meet theum their the comply with their criteria then they're going to make a purchase here and manage with the the continuously monitoring services to tackle this huge challenge I assembled our talented people from the various field U carbo market and insurance and then machine learning and then the data science we've completed more than 50 the market F survey and we name as a

[1:18:53] finalist CP 29 glob green ination challenge great job anyone have a question anyone who liked that one all right off go go here let's see the let's see the clicker all right so I mentioned um I mentioned Charles Draper was the inspiration for Tony Stark there was a guy Menan night uh as a teenager hiked a mountain got frostbite double ampute could have crawled up in a ball and hated life and and you know be a statistic instead he is Tony Stark and the real Tony Stark um Robert Downey Jr hangs out with this guy he's a peer of remesas let me introduce you to Hugh hair come on down Hugh hair runs a lab he collocates with rshh the two of them have a lot of things not in common but there's some intersection this is the bumping connecting of like crazy bat crazy bat makes you know unique stuff that no one else could come up with he's doing the brain to bionics uh can you say something profound and provocative for like a minute Hugh hair oh my God I just I was like coming from the bathroom trying to squeeze through and John grabbed me um yeah my group is right there we're the biomechatronics group and I co-direct the Kay cang Center for bionics a new center here at MIT uh we're just three years into the initial tenure of the center so we we develop um bionic prostheses and also exoskeletons um that are actually controlled by by the brain um the the limbs that I'm wearing are previous inventions that we did about a decade ago these are intrinsically controlled so they run on algorithms they're not connected to my brain but the limbs we're now developing in in the lab um the person can think and move the mechatronics and when when the mechatronics are touched and move they they experience Natural Touch cutaneous

[1:20:55] Sensations and proception so we're we're closing the loop between synthetic mechatronics and the the peripheral nervous system and when we do that embodiment occurs so I I view my artificial limbs as tools they're very powerful tools but they're tools nonetheless I don't view them when you ask me what is my body I don't include the mechatronics but in our subjects where we link the brain bir directionally when you ask them what is your body they actually include the mechatronics and part as part of their body schema which is deeply profound I'm going to cut you off so people want more um one minute the diary if you don't have one buy one and right that you heard from Hugh hair today at this moment he is a badass and sometimes the windows are darkened because he's doing like top secret stuff to help people and if you're getting old and you need bionics it's going to have come from his lab and he's a peer of remesas we love Hugh and if you're trying to rate him on the scale he ain't there we just inserted him ladies and gentlemen uh um number revolutionizing corporate event planning with AI these are two Pros who have a lot of Industry experience Fiesta Pro let's see if they're worthy of a jacket uh well that's a tough act to follow but we'll try um so we are Fiesta Pro and we are here to revolutionize corporate event planning with artificial intelligence so how many of you here in this audience have some kind of corporate event or party this month good number of you who has an idea of how long it takes to plan one of those events yeah uh any guesses yeah it takes um let's see 150 hours and over four months to organize one of those it's exhausting and it's outdated and as seasoned

[1:22:58] professionals and event planners we knew that there had to be a better way and that's why we created Fiesta Pro um we would not have been able to solve this problem last year but with AI agents coming online now we're able to tackle it for the first time ever so our solution is an AI agent with our MVP we're going to start with venue and vendor collaboration that's a process that traditional involves endless back and forth with Fiesta Pro we're going to save 60 hours of time and $2,000 for an event of 150 people um and that's just the beginning as a next step we want to add a central hub for seamless stolder collaboration so you can handle your approvals and your attendee engagement all in one place along the way we're going to be gathering data both from the event spaces that we work with and from our clients to provide actionable insights and creative tailored recom recommendation so we can really enhance corporate events and there's a bigger picture here people are craving more human connection and that's what we really care about most of us in this room spend most of our time at work our Grand Vision is to use our technology and the data that we're Gathering to transform corporate events into meaningful experiences that people are going to be talking about for years to come um we have a demo of our product um so here our AI agent is autonomously sourcing venues it's contacting them about their availability about their amenities their pricing it's making recommendations for us and then it's handling the preliminary negotiations back and forth Fiesta Pro is already making event planning smarter faster and stress-free um so why now uh AI as Dave was just saying can communicate with websites and human beings via voice and via text that is brand new in the world right now and it

[1:25:01] is creating a huge opportunity in the event planning space and we have created Fiesta Pro to capitalize on that we are poised to be the first aid driven userfriendly coste effective corporate event planner and uh the event Tech space is booming Cent was acquired last year by Blackstone for $4.6 billion that's it great questions see everyone the judges are saving for the demo stations that's when they're going to really unleash question let's talk about the team you just getting to the team slide but uh tell us how you're going to grow and expand this team um yeah so we uh are looking for a tech lead so that would be the next person that we're bringing on board and then um once we have a tech person we have what we need to get started we want to we're looking for customers as our next step so if anybody's planning an event uh in the next couple of months we're looking for people to Pilot our product yes and maybe just regarding the team um Louise has 15 years of experience in entertainment industry and I hold 15 years of experience in user experience in built environments thank you go there yeah um so my my kids are 21 and 19 but they grew up on PAW Patrol which she created so that she's a hero in my book um all right so uh kyrgistan 7 million people live in kyrgystan um and 75 million people live in the uh Central uh Asia area where kyrgistan is our next presenter is the only kyani I don't know if I said that right at Harvard or MIT and she's on a mission to build something that she can bring back uh to her her country uh grad match AI driven graduate program and Mentor matchmaking platform if she gets this off the ground maybe there'd be more

[1:27:02] kastanis at MIT ladies and Gentlemen let's see what she got okay guys what okay guys according to National Association of the US admission College counseling 40% of international students do not have sufficient information in the US about program fit and University culture now imagine a platform that simplifies the college application search by using a to match them with the ideal universities just like how dating apps match with compatible Partners our Tinder for Education AK grad match not only simplifies the search for the uh perfect ideal University but also provides a personalized mentorship and resources to craft a standout application so our team consist of uh expert who is who are working at admissions officer at Harvard at Tech experienced uh people and also Educational Consultants amazing mentors from two universities Harvard and MIT so the pro oops so the problem we are solving is information overload ideal University Feit and also budget Feit to uh get into those schools okay so Central Asia consists of five countries Kazakhstan Tajikistan turkistan and usbekistan total population in the region is 75 um million people so there is a um a population boom limited compet and economic growth also you can see that the GDP annually increasing by 6.2 creating dispos Rising disposable incomes so how what is our solution is AI powered matchmaking for graduate education and mentorship so what students do is they go to the platform input academic background interest the uh University culture is it more International or less International and

[1:29:03] platform generates these outputs personalize top five University recommendation based on your background but also personalized acceptance acceptance rate and also find the right mentor to get into those schools how we going to sell it Central Asian students they tend to buy the subscription based things so we are providing basic standard premium for them to choose one and start the application what are we asking today we are asking a startup uh launch of the platform of $10,000 also we are seeking most importantly mentorship and network join me today and join me now because schools like Harvard and MIT they need unique talents from Central Asia to come and represent them here but also they need them now thank you all right let's go any questions thank you uh it's not entirely clear to me uh what the mentors would do for the students could you explain that please so mentors in the premium uh sub uh features they will be walking them step by step to craft those standout application because in Central Asia traditional Consulting agen still are in demand so uh oneon-one U mentoring still like uh in demand for students what's the incentive for the mentor to do that oh uh currently this Market is uh growing so much a lot of students they uh providing their own services like um a lot of students going back to their country and providing oneon-one um services so the incentives just personal uh gain that make money out of this but we are providing the more clients on this platform thank you all right uh thank you so um our next team is uh private Intel uh they're two Sloan fellows one from Nigeria the other from

[1:31:05] China and their aspiration is to keep this going this isn't just an assignment for them a AI powered rag to help Drive insights for p firms uh I also um did I pass this out yeah this is the the 70 years of AI just to remind you that one day they're going to put this event on that um and if people feel they're too far back there's they this Atrium has a deck there and a Sky Deck up there if you want to just walk up you can get even closer uh to the speakers and I saw the founder of scratch walk by scratch has had over a billion uh users so you never know who's in the room all right ladies and gentlemen our next presenter thank you um let's begin by imagining the problems private Equity are facing today so data is key to their decision making yet is stored and scattered all over the place in inconsistent format such as email spreadsheet news articles meeting minutes you name it so it takes the analyst and associate hours to copy and paste uh information from various sources into models and report on this repetitive human intensive labor work it's not only time consuming but it's prompt to human error so when it comes to investment teaser creation there's another paino that you need to uh combine real realtime Market intelligence integration that is why we come up with our Solutions uh private Intel which is an AI power um um investment memo generator um um based on LM um architecture and combining Pro proprietary and public datas togethers so uh let's take a quick look of the the market size um our logic is the the global pum and then 2% management out of that is like 130 billion per years and we allocate 15% for um technological spending and uh 30% for specific AI

[1:33:07] tools but it's quite um quite um low at the moment so we expect like huge Market potentials for growth um in terms of the um current competitive landscape there are very I of um vendors available at the market so there are AI search engines for external and internal data there are AI Market scals there are AI researchers and AI um dual diligence vendors in the market but our Solutions will uh focus on AI um investment memo generation so the key features are um we not only scraped a live uh data you could also um upload the propriety data in PDF Excel format whatever you name it and you can customize investment template um to choose like which uh sessions you want to include and exclude it like by dragging its super user friendly interface and then within seconds the algorithms will combine and synthesize the public and private data together um to come up with an a format for you to export and share now Bernard will demonstrate the Prototype Dio okay thank you um and as George did say um our mode essential is be able to use internal private data and be able to sit on public data to sort of like synthesize what our investment thesis looks like um this is an example of our report works you look at an investment generated memo you think about what you want to invest in you think about what's critical to you we have a rag that combines open air and um Lama llm and we also have our own personal investment thesis so we sit this together and we're able to generate this we think that we're the right team to be able to build this we have an ex someone that has exited in the fintech company and um Joy is good great job all right question thanks um so uh you know rag allows you to put uh the your internal documents into the AI but if you want to go into live sources which Lama will not do and neither will rag how do you how

[1:35:09] are you pulling the latest uh research from the internet like is there a search xng or something of that sort that you're tapping in so we're using open air extens that's oh you're using openi and is that updated the back end for openi yes we're using it because time an API integration okay thanks all right all right our uh so here put your hand up if you have five fingers go all right we're down to the last five okay I'm sorry that only five but if you can't wait to talk to people we only got five um I write a uh AI column for Forbes daily I had 100,000 uh readers this last month my just showed me I plan to write about some of these if anyone has a quote of something I don't want to be too salesy but feel free to email me Jay Warner mit.edu I'm going to write about some of these all right our next guy from Shanghai he's a slown fellow what he's going to present he's going to continue doing uh he's a big basketball fan I asked him if yain was his favorite he said no he's a center I'm a little guy I like Alan ion uh 76ers are playing the uh Celtics uh on Christmas that was going to be a big game I have a feeling it's not going to be a big game but he's going to be rooting for uh 76ers uh ladies and gentlemen money Woods hi everyone uh my name is Alan uh just as Alan Aon uh that's what I chose to name myself uh but we're doing mwood uh youth mental Wellness uh 33% of the global population actually experiences negative emotions including sadness frustration anger Etc and in the us alone uh youth mental health is a26 billion Market among adolesence uh one in six experienced major uh experienced major depressive episodes and 3 million had serious thoughts of suicide so this is a critical issue and requires meaningful changes to the industry uh so we are doing our research uh in the process of doing our research we identify the polarities in current

[1:37:09] solutions that doesn't solve the many of the issues uh one is Professional Services that are usually uh bip pyment and uh usually time consuming and not access to everybody and the other is engaging focused tools that usually are entertainment driven and the lack of customization and the professional guidances and some of them even have non side effects so what the market currently lacks uh is a combination of profession professional credibility as well as engaging userfriendly experiences so what we do here is that uh we are collaborating with MGH uh to build a AI powered platform that integrates all kinds of of clinically uh proven uh tools to help students uh in this kind of process so including um uh journaling uh including fantasy exploration uh including uh uh meditation or even other breathing exercises uh tailor to uh all kinds of different needs for them and and we have uh buil a demo here and according to uh our uh uh plan uh we are doing this uh to equip ourself provide uh professional uh great uh Services uh powered by MGH research uh so that all our tools are credible uh evidence-based and effective at the meantime we are trying to do uh we are doing uh 247 Services uh so that anyone uh in need and anywhere they are anytime uh they can get access of help and at the meantime we're doing uh screening and prec CBT Therapies uh so that uh they have U uh keep motivated and keep involved uh we also buil partnership with uh Dynamic assessment and track data with therapists and schools uh for further interferences uh so with expertise in healthcare and artificial intelligence

[1:39:09] uh we are redefining this industry uh with artificial uh with AI and uh at the mean time we believe this is not just about uh treatment of uh symptoms uh this is more about uh uh to equip uh young people with tools uh to uh build resilience and uh Thrive thank you great job see you Alan all right uh Dave did this thing where he challenged everyone he said oh my name's Dave blondon rhymes with London I love London whatever so he said everyone should try to say something memorable as a way to you know connect with people and you can see some people are carrying that in I also want to let you in on the class remesh at the end of class would just stand there and and talk to everyone and anyone about their idea and help shape it and be a sparring partner it's kind of like Rocky but different uh and he he pushed people and and you see the fruits of that so uh let's give a round of applause for the great remes hey given what he did that's not big enough let's give a round of applause for the great raes all right all right all right so let me see four fingers all right we're down to the last four all right uh Jane did over 2,000 uh reports for Bloomberg and Hong Kong uh this team is three Chinese they're from three different provinces someone from Pakistan you may recognize him like where's Waldo he was in another team so he's Moonlighting on two teams I don't know if the other team knows that um let's hear what Gio um n has to say and this one's kind of interesting because Dave mentioned how things have changed in the last few months with AI this is the first group that has a visual um Tool uh you know a lot of the others are are are data or uh or text ladies and gentlemen Geo

[1:41:09] narrative thank you guys uh I'm Jen I used to be a tech reporter at Bloomberg and uh I want to quick survey here how many of you have been following us presidential election news in the previous months yeah I guess almost everyone how to do this uh Google news apps or I bet someone is using chbt and I think oops sorry yeah this is probably what you will get uh better than Google but I think still a lot to read if it can be visualized it will be much easier but to be honest I think this is how complicated it is if you really want to do itting traditional ways and think about this this is what you say from major uh mainstream news uh news rooms like very interactive very engaging but to be honest with you as a reporter at Bloomberg I know this kind of project takes months of preparation and it's really a trouble for people to make this uh we want to use AI to change this and here's where how we are going to do this yeah so basically um that we have a um so we have a like a model that you know uh on the left hand side is the traditional model that you see every day and on the right hand side is actually or we model is actually with our own model all models because it's super difficult we have like uh two steps one step is actually we trying to train to understand what user is asking and the second step is actually trying to generating you know from the uh understandings trying to generate the page layout all the things like that so for just I I mean just imagine like you know if you asking CH

[1:43:09] where the uh the presidential campaign where they they went uh here is like uh actually the uh the video you can just simply put your uh sentence prompt like where they went uh for both presidential candidates and then you click generate you have the map uh you have all the you know all the storytelling things you have the event details you have where they went you have the you know the the the like the context difference and also you have the photos like you know just just for your uh comparations so this is actually quite complex and uh we just trying to make the visualization much easier for people and also we think that is not limited by only for journalism it could be also for travelers and for government agencies so this is our team that we have you know uh I'm a more than 10 years uh realization uh engineer and we also have Stelling person we also have journalism we also have data uh data scientist Stu yeah that's our presentation thank you all right question any question all right could you give a few other examples other than this map that you were just describing or showing it could technically be anything so it so what we're trying to say is that if you give a narrative that we can actually produce visualizations that are more interactive and more explanatory I'm a medical doctor for instance um if for instance if I'm going through a patient history and what things happened over the course of time for the patient and if you just put everything everything in there and then there will be visualizations that patient maybe was an expert in this country moved to this country these were the records in here this is the patient's whole story and then we also talked about like it it can be help uh help in the UR Urban Development as well um and all the sorts of uh different um scenarios of few you all right so um who've heard of

[1:45:11] uber all right so Uber didn't happen till 16 years in the web 2 it took someone to realize hey let's use all these converging Technologies our next guy speaks Arabic his parents are from Egypt he's Egyptian he grew up in London he uh trained to be a doctor and I've actually been seeing this a lot in our class we get these MDS who are coming and getting off the pipeline to be a traditional doctor and they want to use technology he's using Technologies which he thinks can be the Uber of um of uh product planning ladies and gentlemen do it with me all right bu to move go very much thank you for the kind introduction so my name is Omar and I'm here to present M to you mikette is the AI powered Marketplace connecting Elite Talent with high impact projects and I'm going to keep it very principle based and Foundations based as I was through this so there's a few reports and I'm going to show you these reports but there's some huge huge data and research which shows you that there's a few problems with coming up with success products one of them is or projects one of them is getting the right brief so you know if you're a manager part of the issue you look at the end result and you're like well we didn't have the right brief and that's why we didn't know what what what worked part of it is it spends hours and hours and hours looking at freelance platforms or candidates to find the right people for your jobs and the final thing is well we don't have the right tools to present this AI can come in and solve all of these things these are some of the big reports from the Harvard Business Review McKenzie did a brilliant report last year um and uh de and various other people have always spoken about the issues that organizations face so how do we fix it well mck will solve all of these three problems rmes used to always tell us in class that's great this is a great problem but what are you going to do about it well we're going to go through each of the things the principle based problems that project completion has and fixed them so one is we have an AI brief generator that already exists so you can go on m.com right now put in

[1:47:12] whatever problem you have and it will solve it for you there's then an algorithm so it takes 10 to 12 hours on freelance platforms like upwork and fiver to find the right candid our algorithm does it in seconds okay and the final thing is building data sets to create these tools to complete these projects to the highest of Standards currently all of our talent is purely from MIT and Harvard so it's a super super high Talent platform based um project these are our competitor analysis and you can see how big these companies are and Dave said a brilliant thing to us he said merco was one of the fastest growing companies and it proved that there is appetite and scalability in AI driven marketplaces they're worth £250 million or dollars after two years um mikette is coming in to try and redefine that project completion space there's huge inefficiencies and AI can come in and solve those um that is our road map which shows you what our plan is we've got five Pilots running at the moment and around $5,000 which has come through the platform uh with 100 users and this is the team so this is myself uh and my best friend in London who's uh who are both MDS and have' gone off to do this thank you for listening and I'm open to any questions all right he's yielding 30 seconds to questions so you got a minute 30 for questions anyone you're a doc what do you got are you listening yes all right you got a question see if he has a what I don't have a question but we'll play back what you just heard uh all right all right I youbody John Sharp you're aor what do you think I think it's great why'd you grow your hair long sorry any other questions all right have you considered uh companies like Alphas sites and Guido as competitors that's an excellent question they came up at all compor analysis um what we found is no one has the whole AI process and no one has ACC MIT tal which fortunately because I'm here right now okay last question question keep going on that same thing had the same

[1:49:15] question you're an MD uh the way the AI technolog is evolving it's empowering you to to actually build software product how are you going to build out the team how's this class related to that so I I think the class was fantastic for that and like I said Ramesh would always push us as to solve the biggest problems that exist um I think this platform has great use in healthcare as well just as anything else um all right I'm cutting you off there bye and I don't mean to be rude I love all these uh students um but you know we got a show to run all right um some of the biggest events that haven't yet happened they brought in Power Players to kind of conceive of them our next speaker from Costa Rica spent a ton of time in London spent a ton of time on another team she was up here before if you think you're seeing double or it's her twin tapestry ai ai powered uh user engagement and crowd Management in high density spaces this is high density but this ain't the high density that she's talking about ladies and Gentlemen let's see what she got go thank you um I love people especially a crowd of people what can I do but even for people like myself crowds can be stressful so what can I do tapestry is founded by experts in user Centric Urban Design and AI systems tapestry is a self- orchestrating digital fabric for buzzling environments in busy places like festivals it's hard to navigate new surroundings while navigating the overwhelming information and we often miss out on events this this affects millions and impacts a 10 trillion experienced economy the problem is the opportunity because 75% of people are willing to pay for convenience tapestry is a smart guide to help individuals find what they like and need in busy places and to help businesses plan accordingly with highly specialized

[1:51:16] agents for the different stakeholders we have visitor agents vendor agents and organizer agents working together in the background coordinating for the optimum solution these agents work together as a smart real-time guide today artificial intelligence iot iot and the booming experience economy break tapestry a uniquely positioned offering our approach allows for scalability the modular alent structure is highly commercial as it can be customized and expanded it allows for continuous learning and for emergent intelligence where agent interactions lead to innovative solutions it's scalable across ecosystems from 20,000 sports events to 30 million city-wide festivals like India's Kela the world's largest people Gathering um this is the road map as we scale across the events our road map here takes place in Fenway Park where we can see the different colors of the agents the visitor AG agents the vendor agents and the organizer agents working directly with their stakeholder and coordinating amongst themselves avoiding long lines pinning the nearest facility relocating mobile vendors and nudging promotions personalized promotions to incentivize behavior and influence space Dynamics scalable across ecosystems we're enhancing engagement convenience and operations for the different stakeholders our team holds a deep expertise in built environments and AI systems I'm Maria designing for 15 years for people understanding how we perceive and navigate our surroundings and my co-founder Luis holds 13 years leading AI driven Logistics we're interweaving intelligence into the fabric of buzzling environments we want to grow from 30,000 to 30 million we're excited to be part

[1:53:16] of the MIT kathon supporting an AI first um cumella for 2027 quick question you're your your co-founder uh your co-founder thank you thanks wow so your co-founder it says CTO of something else right now is he really where is he now and he's in Costa Rica and we've worked on two previous projects together over the past 10 years he's joining for sure yes he's joining we got into um the MIT fuse accelerator we're going to Pivot and do an MVP and test with everyone here on campus so he'll be here in January all right right go uh JP has big Connections in Columbia University he represented Columbia University at the inauguration of uh Sally corn booth at MIT thank you J so great demo um I want to know a little bit more about your go-to Market strategy yes so we want to position ourselves with the smaller ecosystems we're starting here with MIT um we're going to be working over the course of the spring term to develop a pivate uh scheme and sort the MVP here on campus um with the event calendar and the different um University students and scale up gradually okay exit that way go all right do it with me one number one right doesn't mean this is the number one team that you could decide that but you got to hear it just means this is the last one so um one of the co-founders was the ministry of Science and education for his whole country country of 20 million they launched Yuri gregan uh into space Kazakhstan the other one is from Nigeria they have 220 million people few few more uh and he they have 235 different languages these two have teamed up to create an AI powered website has to do with avatars and agents uh I know Mark benof put something out uh kind of like like punching Microsoft in the gut saying hey agents of the future you have it wrong with open Ai and stuff uh let's see what

[1:55:16] these guys have to say this is number one and then the fun is just going to begin you you get to go around and meet all these teams who's excited to meet a team all right who's going to ditch out of here just take a slice of pizza or whatever and get out of here no price of admission is you get to meet these people and I recommend getting their autographs because some of these people are going to be household names that you're going to want to say I was there when they were nothing and and turned into something at this juncture of their uh Lifeline uh ladies and gentlemen number one hello everyone does it work okay so don't you think that uh in the era of AI traditional websites are already outdated me and my co-founder berners will believe so we see that traditional websites outdated inefficient and time consuming because any user when they visit any website they usually uh looking for a specific piece of information but with all this uh data overload information news they get lost or they spend too much time to find a specific what they are looking for so we're building we're improving this uh human and website uh communication we believe that web pages in the era of AI will transform to personas where web pages can talk with their users provide information and a efficient m manner so there will be voice interaction and uh uh most importantly multilingual support and also it is very important to note that it will be accessible for visually impaired people the market is growing uh we found data that uh in the next 10 years uh this Market will grow 10 times so now I would like to uh give the floor to my co-founder BN all right thanks um so at

[1:57:18] AI web what we are essentially what we're essentially looking at is transforming web and web interactions we think there's no better time such as now to use AI to interpret what web used to look like and bring it to the Modern Age um my personal experience is coming to MIT I wanted a particular grad program that was tailored to my own experience and I ended up spending about two hours and I think it's the same experience everyone at MIT we have so many resources to consume from is there such a way that when I need information I can just go on the website and ask it for information it generates my information without being another open AI um this is what we envision that the new website would look like um I'm happy to show you at any point when I need information I just go on the website and I make an ask and is's able to give me that information in real time without giving me multiple links multiple links multiple links um we are the right team to build this uh we both are slone fellows and we have experience in Tech Tech and education our ask is that we're looking for more technical Founders and Visionary investors that see the future in different ways from static websites to websites that have Persona please join us thank you any question you've uh presented yourselves asbi Howard website why did you not present one of your products or a website created from your technology that would blow us away okay so up until to this morning our initial version demo wasn't working so what we could do was just to video this and have this up but like we're happy to take your question if it come to our stand we show you what we have working yeah okay so uh exit thank you great job all right so like in spinal tap let's go to 11 we did not know what it would be like going to mock two I mean 20 we went

[1:59:21] to 24 we've never ever had 24 presentations you could have been a little more disciplined and like first forced a few mergers you feel okay about the 24 would be more strict next time yeah all right next semester uh same Thursday uh in April as always uh come back for more and then next year this is in perpetuity you could count on the sunrising and you can count on this class uh and and we can count on you um what I would like we're video you know this is being streamed we have I think double or triple the number of people online watching that are in this room right now I'd like to recognize the judges you know some of them may be thinking wow that was the best hour two hours actually three hours I've give I've given or some maybe I want that time back let's see judges if you felt good about today please come stand up here with this nice uh brand um yeah no I know I know so judges come up here and then you don't know it but I'm going to call on Five of you to say something profound but now you know all right here stand this way for the photo uh an aadi can you uh do Chris yeah okay okay all right judges come on up all right so um so you didn't realize there are so many judges like wow they're they're like sleeper agents they're everywhere um so I I would like a few judges like Dave kind of did some historical stuff um you know some of these judges were there all semester uh some are just coming today and you know they're they're going to claim they were there all semester they weren't we know who you are no but these are this is a cross-section of society and and these are people that that that can help in terms of talent funding all sorts of stuff there's a cooling off period um where you none of these people can invest for uh a bunch of days and that's something that we really respect and that's part of uh how MIT operates but let me call on three people just to say something profound um all right Dave why don't you go first and then I'll decide who's next yes Sasha all right so we're living in this

[2:01:22] accelerated time window that's like no time window I've seen since uh the internet was invented and kind of the window of 95 to 2000 and I've never seen so many concurrent companies succeeding in parallel in a single theme since the internet what's going on right now in AI is easily an order of magnitude maybe two orders of magnitude bigger than that window from 95 to 2000 and just to support that uh Omar mentioned a company mkor uh they just got an unsolicited term sheet at a $2 billion valuation they have fewer than 20 employees these are numbers I've never seen before their revenue went from 1 million to 50 million in a single year I mean these are real companies and so the Tailwind for the teams you saw today is the strongest Tailwind we've ever seen and it's it's accelerating this particular semester is tough because most of those teams now need to go back do one more semester of school and then they hit the ground running in the summer with their actual companies so my charge to the companies is you have now coming into the holidays you don't have time for the holidays this holiday you need to run like hell we MIT is incredibly generous in giving everybody January you can do anything you want in January so keep running with your companies and get as far as you can in January and then keep those teams bonded during the the uh spring semester that's the challenge if you can do that and get to the summer you're going to win yeah I noticed open AI said they're going to launch something every day the next 10 days you know they're not they're not doing the holiday thing all right yeah Sasha uh uh yeah what do you got so it was wonderful to see all your demonstrations thank you uh you were truly in the best time to build an AI company now um and you're also seeing a flood and influx of capital so I think it's great to see so many different industries that all of the different companies here today are going after um and I think the step change that you'll see that AI is creating will mean that your companies get bigger significantly faster um and so I'm sure we'll see several unicorns coming out of these classes soon ni all

[2:03:23] right our last two one sentences flew in from India let's see if he thinks it was worth it and then you work at Google you know are you here to like suck ideas over to Google let's see what you have to say so I'm working for a Google Cloud platform daily on a daily basis we are discussing with our customers how J can be used and I was blown away with the breadth of different use cases that I saw here absolutely inspired thank you so much for having me um hey so I came in from India but uh I used to be in the B are doing a bunch of startups uh and I love the energy that I see here it reminds me of the original Bay Area uh we've been doing deep tech for a long time and I love what I see here so it's a fantastic ecosystem glad to be a part of it thank you very all right and um I want to recognize the video team they produce mit's graduation uh the Super Bowl of uh graduations uh and they you know one day they will say we documented those amazing ideas that change society and I want to give it up for rsh for you know having High aspirations a big Vision that we want to have impact it's not just about creating ripoffs of Angry Bird you know we got to we got to do good with this technology uh raes will you say something profound that's my middle name right uh I'm sorry I'm still recovering from a flu I'm very low energy uh but it was totally worth it right 24 teams amazing judges just a fantastic energy thank you everyone first of all um if anybody's interested in the SE CR behind what we call a venture Studio course not an entrepreneurship course we don't teach you how to choose fonts and how to interview your customers and how to use Excel but we actually focus on how can you create gigas skill impact potential a ventures so the secret formula is in this booklet I have a few copies uh I'll share with you how we run this course and of course if you ping us we s the PDF as well um it's called The Spot lucrative problem and probe the opportunity so take a look at that um I think as Dave said um there's something

[2:05:26] magical about this semester because uh unlike previous semester we could you could conceptualize we only have about you know 10 weeks uh it's amazing you know this 70 80 almost 100 students and the extended community of about 140 total people in these 24 teams they have been working non-stop for the last 10 weeks and in previous years the best they could do is you know build a concept or taking forward but what's really heartening to me you know makes me really emotional is they have been able to build Solutions and demonstrate them from from an idea that wasn't even uh you know well flushed out 10 weeks ago to something that's out there so I really want to congratulate all the teams for for you know really taking it all the way this time thank you and and and then and then finally you know we have somebody here from Google we have other entities you know they're going to be very cautious you know they're looking at all of you uh and I think there's something amazing Happening Here uh in Cambridge in 0 to 1 through 9 uh and Beyond um so I think this is really a moment if you're doing anything else in life whatever your other passion maybe it's time to take a pause and think about what are we going to do with this intelligence Revolution and how are we going to create gigascale impact so we hope to see you next semester um and continue to this this tradition thank you
