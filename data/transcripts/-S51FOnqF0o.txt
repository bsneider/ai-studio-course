[0:01] Welcome to the Nanda summit happening here uh at MIT uh July 14th and 15th. Uh we are so delighted you are here. I am Romesh Rascar uh professor at MIT and also the director of the Nanda program. Uh Nanda stands for AI agents uh in decentralized architecture but it's also the name of my sister. makes it very convenient. Uh if you think about the architecture right now, uh we feel like we are in the mainframe era of of AI. you know much like in the 60s and 70s and 80s you can write you know command line interfaces to talk to the mainframes we talk to this big machines uh you know that can either train or serve us uh the big models uh from there slowly we are moving into the intranet of AI and AI agents where companies are launching their uh agent marketplaces and they're helping other enterprises create AI agents where they kind stay within some environment and then they disappear. So that's the intranet of AI agents. From there we need to move to the internet of AI agents and you know internet is a scary place. So as these agents go on a road trip and meeting amazing other other agents and they're communicating and navigating uh you know we have to deal with lots of issues a lot of trust issues. So that's the decentralized AI. Uh but then internet to the worldwide web was a big shift because internet was about connecting computers. Uh and the worldwide web was about bringing you know people and businesses onto this network. Uh and for that we required things like HTTP and HTTPS and URL and browsers and so on. Um and what's going to be all those things for the agentic

[2:01] web. Uh so that's what Nanda is. Uh so we'll talk a little bit more about that. Uh how we going to create the web of uh AI agents. Now as I said uh we want to imagine this notion that billions every one of us will have an agent. So billions of agents but possibly trillions of agents uh that are navigating on the internet and during this road trip you know they're encountering other agents that they don't know what to do about. They're going to meet access other resources uh but they're also going to learn and earn and socialize uh with other agents sometimes autonomously sometimes on our behalf. So I want you to have that mental image of agents you know on a road trip on the internet. Um so it's also important to think about we are kind of moving into a post AI world. You know, of course, we haven't solved all the problems in AI. Uh, but just like in the early '9s, we were moving to the post PC world. It's like assuming they're good enough PCs. So, it's about connecting those pieces and that's what the internet and the web was about. So, we are moving to this post AI world. Um, and on the right side are things that we obviously need like compute and data um and and uh uh you know ability to create agents and so on. That's fine. That's important. That's like having pieces. But when we want to actually create the network of those AI agents, look at the left column. So we need foundations which is authentication registries. Uh we need trust, we need reputation, you know, know your agent. Then we need abilities to connect them, communicate them. So many amazing protocols like A2A from Google or MCP from Anthropic, you know, are are coming together. But there's so much more than that we have to do. uh then there are transactions and then there are uh agent stores or agent marketplaces and applications. So the the the stack on the left is what we are talking about when we mean by the

[4:02] internet of a agents and within there are seven major problems we have to solve uh to do that. Um and today we won't go through that but uh over the next two days uh you'll hear a lot about it. So when we think about for example um uh for example when we think about communication uh it's just not just communicating uh you know between two agents but it's also the orchestration of it. How do you create teams of agents? And when we talk about transactions, uh it's not just about transacting in money and data, but it's also transacting in intelligence, right? So, Michael, you're right in the first row. And I might want to buy, you know, half a kilogram of his intelligence. You know, what does that mean? What is what is the metric? How do I price it? Um, you know, I mean, Michael is a super smart guy, so maybe he's going to charge me maybe not $100, thousand dollars, maybe a million dollars for half half a kilogram of intelligence. Um, and somebody else is going to ask like, why is Romesh agents intelligence half a kilogram of his intelligence only $100, but Michael is a million dollars? Why is that? So, you know, there's there'll be metric, there'll be pricing. Uh, and also, uh, what does it mean for me when I buy the half a kilogram? If I con, if I convince Michael, can I use it only for myself or can I resell it to somebody else? It's like DRM for music. I can only use it for myself. So, it runs into all kinds of issues. Uh when it comes to um marketplaces, uh you know, if you think about an Amazon marketplace, uh if I buy an umbrella from say Vietnam, it shows up my doorstep for 10 bucks, which is kind of magical. If you think about, you know, an umbrella gets created, it gets shipped, you know, it gets transported all to all the way to my doorstep for $10. And of course, the reason why it's so cheap is because lot other people in Cambridge are also buying junk on Amazon. So, the costs get amortized and I get it for 10 bucks. But that's not true for AI today. Every one of us is

[6:03] having a one-on-one interaction uh with AI. And so, there's no cost averaging. There's no amortization of those costs. So if millions of people want to do roughly the same thing in terms of training or inference or teaming, uh we need ways to do that together. So there are many research problems, many technological problems we need to solve as we're building, you know, the internet of of AI agents. Uh and so this has been a long journey for us uh in our lab here uh at MIT. uh thinking about you know how do you create uh you know AI that you know designs better AI uh privacy based machine learning that allows us to work across silos you know how do we create this knowledge pricing markets uh that I talked about a few minutes ago with half a kilogram of intelligence and also all the decentralization ideas uh that have been inspired by by the web 3 world. So I want you to imagine a city of Asians. Okay? Um and u you know when you move into a new city uh you know uh you know let's say Mike moves into a new city you know Mike needs uh his driver's license you know he has to uh get a house register his house uh and so on. Uh but very soon he has to go find a job and figure out whether he's going to get paid you know $10 an hour $30 an hour or $1,000 an hour for his services. So somebody else has to kind of you know put put him in that in that knowledge pricing. Uh and over time Mike gets settled in and you know starts making friends and realizes maybe he should go to another school and learn more skills starts teaming with others uh and you know and the society emerges. So we really want you to think about uh Nanda as nurturing a city of AI Asians. Uh and that's why Nanda is structured in three different phases. The first phase is Asian foundation uh which is this notion of you know you know in the in the in the real world uh you have your driver's license housing addresses um and then at the same time the city needs to build

[8:05] some infrastructure you know city has to build roads that's like A2A you know communication uh you know structure that allows two agents to communicate uh or you need abilities to you know have uh tools and services in your house and your neighborhood you know That's like access to tools, that's like MCP. Uh, and Nanda index that we'll talk about is more like the addresses of those houses, right? Uh, and as Mike moves in, his own address might be, you know, listed in the, you know, the the registry of uh, you know, of the city, all the house addresses and who lives where. Uh, but where he works, you know, he might be bu working in a 30-story building. uh uh and that particular company his company does not reveal all the tenants of that building the the the you know the company might just release the address of the reception the front desk you know we are at 100 Main Street but we won't tell you who who's our tenants that's the only thing that's registered with the city and that's kind of you know how we we'll talk about the Nanda index uh in a minute uh when it comes to commerce uh again you know we have agencies that have to certify uh that you know Mike has particular degrees uh and you know he has to um kind of list himself on LinkedIn and maybe find the job and then have some kind of a interviews and figure out whether he's going to make $30 an hour or $100 an hour uh and so on. Uh and that's a very dynamic pricing right of of how that would be. Uh and we need a similar infrastructure uh that's built uh for agents. So what's the LinkedIn for agents is going to look like? And then finally as we start to build the Asian society uh you know there's going to be teaming you know there's going to be certification um there's going to be trust uh and so on and and all this also start playing roles. So as I said earlier uh if you want to you know create uh e-commerce platforms for us to buy junk from from Amazon a lot of other infrastructure has to emerge right it's not just about you

[10:05] know creating a vehicle that starts a transportation system that starts in Vietnam and lands on my doorstep lot of other things happen in between and to to for the infrastructure uh to emerge so I think the Asian society in similar way you know needs a lot of blocks so this is a long journey for us for all of us in this room uh to think about how we going to create you know the agentic web and we think it's going to go through these three phases. So these three phases uh you know is is what we're going to talk about uh foundations Asian economy Asian society and on the bottom left are this uh concept of index and registries and so on. So we're in the very first stage like the stage you know 1.1 1.2 two if you think of the foundation as the phase one of this work. So I hope you realize that we are very far away from getting to the dream of getting a $10 umbrella delivered to your doorstep in the in the agentic world. All right. Um so this road map you know we already shared with you uh on Luma. Uh so you know we have a large program uh here at MIT in collaboration with many other entities. Uh and we're going through this three phases. So we we welcome you to participate in this conversation. Uh and you know you we are here at MIT. We are not here at at YC or you know a trade show. So the next two days are really deep intellectual conversation on where this is going. We'll have a lot of breakouts. We'll have a lot of smart people come and share with us and also disagree with us on on how the agentic web uh should be kept open and neutral and scalable uh and responsible. uh we'll have a lot of breakouts with a lot of working groups. Uh downstairs we will have uh you know a lot of demos and and uh discussions uh and so on. Now what we're talking about has you know a couple of key aspects that I want you to kind of keep in mind. One is that

[12:08] this debate between uh raw intelligence versus intelligence. So you look at the horizontal axis this is how we have worked. we have this highly centralized intelligence where you know companies are spending billions of dollars they're centralizing data compute talent uh and because of that uh you know reluctantly they also have to be in charge of ethics uh of this and and so that's what we're doing and so we kind of built an amazing kind of the mainframe world of of AI and and then it's being rationed you know a little bit here and there to us to create our own personal agents right so even to create personal agents, we're still calling this mainframes, you know, to serve as LLMs and so on. So this is how it's being served. Um, and you know, if we did that, I think the umbrella is going to cost me, you know, thousands of dollars. Uh, so that's what's happening right now on the horizontal axis. We believe there is a different way to think about the internet of uh, AI agents, which is aworked uh, intelligence and which is how the human society behaves as well. Right? So when we are born we have you know an reasonable hardware but really poor software right with our brain and our abilities but what happens is over time we interact with our families you know we grow up we go to schools we try to come to better schools you know like MIT but not the other one down the street um then we you know try to live on the right coast uh we work you know right companies and so on and over time we get smarter our software improves right uh and even then if you think about large organizations like you know with trillion dollar valuation we don't assume that the leader of the organization is the smartest person you think of that person as the most amazing orchestrator but not the most amazing uh you know raw intelligence and then uh we have this society of the mind you know a classic book by Marvin Minsky right here at MIT uh one of the fathers of of AI

[14:08] and so the society of the mind approach says that although every unit is not super smart collectively you know they can become an amazing society. Um so we think the intelligence today which is usually captured in two ways one by uh you know ingesting a lot of data you know u you know kind of machine learning in a lot of data uh and the second uh the way machine learning is is treated is through experiences like reinforcement learning if you have a car you drive around and so on. It's usually done through either uh training on data or training on on uh you know lot of a lot of uh capturing experiences but as you know really what's going on here in this room you know that's not how we do it the way we do it is we interact with each other right so if I meet Michael for half an hour at the end of the conversation I believe both of us are slightly smarter together but I didn't exchange data and I didn't want you to do like a specific experience to learn from you. So the way we work in the society is we learn through interactions and we get these highly condensed forms of intelligence from our collaborators and we absorb them and we become smarter. It's like a teacher and a student or friends or or events like these. So there's a third way to think about how intelligence grows uh and that's the vertical axis. So we believe that Asians start with you know relatively simple uh abilities, relatively simple tools, relatively simple access, very simple rolodex but over time just like us humans over time it gets smarter and smarter and and a given individual agent may not be the smartest but collectively you know it creates a highly democratic you know highly sophisticated society. So that's what we believe in and as you can imagine this is also an antidote to the notion of AGI or super intelligence because you know all the information is siloed.

[16:08] I mean what uh you know a great hospital here in Boston knows will never be known by a super intelligent AGI because they don't have access to the data inside that hospital right but if we have a society of agents then an amazing agent can talk to the agent of the hospital who understands how to you know treat a patient and they can work together to do amazing things without ever revealing their secrets. Okay. uh but there's a barter you know they have to have knowledge pricing and they have to have you know uh a way to figure out how much they should pay for the services. So we think the agent society at least in the beginning will mimic the human society and the vertical access probably more important than the horizontal axis. Of course, we need some centralization. You know, we need some ways to, you know, spend billions of dollars and set up nuclear power plants. You know, let's have it. Uh that centralization is critical, but also we need to think about this highly decentralized approach. All right. Um and so with that mental model that the decentralization is what's really going to drive uh you know the agentic web, we have six working groups uh at this big MIT program. And you'll get a flavor of this over the next two days. You know, first is of course the the first column is kind of the foundations uh and teaming and adapter. You'll see a lot of demos. There's a long hack today this evening from 7:00 p.m. to 10 p.m. in this room. So bring your laptops and you know we'll get you up and running. Uh the second column is kind of the agent economy uh agent commerce. Uh and the third column is you know thinking about uh agent uh Asian marketplaces, agent stores uh and what we call population level AI, right? The example I just gave you of amortized costs when I want to buy the $10 umbrella uh and so on. So I think there's there's a lot going on uh on this road map. So we invite you to engage with us uh in this uh in this working groups. So very briefly right so over the last 10 years amazing things

[18:10] have happened. So for example we invented AutoML you know how AI can design better AI right those things are needed now because as agents just like humans you know nobody gives us nobody sits next to us all the time we we just learn from experiences interaction agents need to learn on their own uh the second problem is as I gave the example with the hospitals you know how do we do this trade-off between siloed data and great intelligence so that techniques like federated learning from Google techniques like split learning from our group here at MIT. Uh and they allow us to build intelligence without ingesting raw data. The data remains where it is and you can combine that. Uh then there is knowledge pricing you know how do I evaluate and how do I price data intelligence inference or somebody else's rolodex right somebody else's access to other resources. Um and then of course the problem of decentralization which is you know how do you you know how do you find the right collaborator? You're at this conference with hundreds of people. Uh how do you figure out who you should talk to? Because over the next two days you can only talk to a handful of people. So you know everybody does the same trick. You ask them in the first five seconds like where are you from? What do you do? And then you immediately make a judgment call. Is it worth spending more time with this person or move on to the next person? Right? Which is kind of cool right? We do this in a very, you know, um, you know, without offending the other person. The agents will have to do the same thing. They'll have to go and talk to a lot of other agents to figure out which agents they should talk to and they should spend time with. But there'll be a lot of fake agents, you know, wasting your time, you know, and uh, you know, and they'll consume your bandwidth uh, and compute. So, you need an easy way to figure out how to figure out, you know, who you should collaborate with, who should you talk to. Uh, and as I said, it's not just about transactions, it's also about intelligence. Um and then once you do collaborate, you also want to learn from them. You want to co-learn. So in today's AI, you know, it's very transactional, right? You you pay for

[20:10] services and you get services, but you don't get smarter together. As I said earlier, uh I might want to get, you know, half a kilogram of, you know, Michael's intelligence and move on. And we have a strong belief that the single most important motivation for agents will be to become smarter. Because in today's society, in human society, being dumb is expensive. But in the agentic world, being a dumb agent who doesn't know how to learn is going to be catastrophically more expensive because every time you transact with intelligence, you have to pay for it. So if you're not improving your intelligence, you'll continue to pay for the differential. So we think the primary motivation for agents will be to become smarter over time and learn from others. So so again this creates you know so um you're welcome to read a lot of our papers on what we call co-learning uh you know collaborator selection uh and so on. So this is kind of a very exciting space of how we're going to think about the agentic web. Um so if you're part of the MIT program of course you know you'll get to participate in this research uh many events like this we have a venture hub uh that you can participate uh and of course the working groups um so I'm very proud that uh the the the Nanda initiative that started you know formally only in the last six months or so you know have had you know dozens of events you know many many partners you know many hacks lots of source code online It's really, really exciting. So, I'm going to uh take a risk and show you a few demos live on the stage. All right. So, first one is everybody should go to uh join39.org and create your own agent. Uh you got an email from Chris uh where you can uh you know uh create that. It'll only take you uh 30 seconds. Uh so if you um you know kind of click on agents, there are many of you who already have created your

[22:10] your own agents. So Rebecca, it's Rebecca here. Uh Yogi, you know, a lot of you have already created your own agents. Um and uh it's so easy to create your own agent. All you do is in this case, it's a Romesh agent. You know, uh all I have to do is log in. Uh click edit and I I just copy pasted my Wikipedia page. That's it. Right? So this just my Wikipedia page I copy pasted and uh hit enter. Uh and with that I can interact with uh with anybody's agent. So looks like looks like uh so I can probably talk to Rebecca's agent because I know her. She was one of my students. You know what do you do? I hope she hasn't put anything uh strange there. Right. Um and that's what it is. And then uh you know she she has she has her own agent name you know big key data love I guess she loves data right so um so she works for this company G19 studio for example and so on right uh you can do the same thing with my agent that's my agent and you can say what do you right? You know, um so again, you can get this agent up and running, right? Uh and you're ready to go. So you can all of you can launch this agent in about 30 seconds, right? It's it's very easy to do. But more importantly, what's happening behind the scenes uh is that it's also creating uh it's like it's like you coming to a new city and getting a driver's license. So you can see my my license right called Asian facts. Um so this is showing you know uh my ID you know uh my my websites you

[24:11] know who has what are my endpoints where my endpoint is running you know what are my capabilities what are my skills uh you know evaluation telemetry certification and you're going to hear more about that right so these agents um just like a driver's license you know has to be certified if I get a degree from MIT MIT certifies you know that I got a degree from here so my capabilities my skills had to be updated uh and they had to be certified by somebody else right so there'll be a whole cottage industry of players you know that's creating uh these services uh to support the identity trust uh and so on um and then we can do something a little bit more sophisticated uh and I will show you uh in the in the evening where we can create um a more detailed agent here. So if you if you go and create a uh your own agent on the on the platform, you know, you'll show up here on the left side, right? So there are hundreds of people who already created that. This just a very barebones user interface. If you're doing your own project, your own startup, you can take this open source code and launch your own solutions. uh and you know I can I can kind of now um do you know uh I can talk to for example here you saw uh it talks to not only personal agents but it can also talk to uh all the MCP agents uh that are out there very soon other A2A agents and so on. So um so we have for example uh connected to smithy agents because that's not the registry that's that's open. So there are about 250 uh agents from smithy and I can just talk to them directly right uh through this I can say you know at smiththery make sure I remember the name of the agent done a good job there so I'm going to do uh you know I'm going to say find a coffee

[26:21] in in Cambridge, right? Um, and it's it's talking to MCP agents, you know, all through all through an adapter. You're going to hear more about this. Um so we we can treat just like you know we are in a city whether you're talking to services in your house which would be like MCP or you talk to another agent another human being but just down the street which is like A2A uh or talk to a company right that's a that's a big interface that's all works out in a very very unified manner um Uh so it's been you know it's been fantastic to collaborate with many companies uh and many partners um you know uh uh you know RA from A2A the the lead of A2A for example will be speaking here tomorrow or you know many tech companies you Dell and Cisco and Akami and HCL and TCS and so on uh you know they're all here you'll be hearing from them you know over for the next day or two. Uh and many of these amazing speakers have spoken in person or online uh on this platform over the last 3 to four months. So go watch their videos and you know if you're if you're really a student of how the agentic web is evolving I I encourage this one exercise. Go and watch their videos from March and April and then start watching those videos later and how everybody's thinking has evolved over time. you know their terminology has evolved their foresights has evolved uh and so on. It's very fascinating uh to watch NL web you know which is from Dr. Guha uh you or Todd Seagull who leads uh A2A you know our colleagues at Salesforce Cisco and so on uh and all these videos are available to you on the project Nanda

[28:21] YouTube channel um and these are some of the great speakers you'll see uh over the next two days uh from various organization researchers uh u investors uh corporate leaders uh and so on uh and also we're very proud of the way uh this emerging so we believe in this notion of white papers and drafts. Uh so every week um you know roughly twice a week uh you know many of these uh scientists and co-authors get together and they brainstorm about you know in a very responsible and very nuanced manner each of these aspects. Um today you'll hear about the Nanda index aspect of it. I'll talk about that for in a minute. Uh and we're very proud. So if you're interested in participating in these conversations, you know, please go to the projectnanda.org website and there's a link for you to to sign up. Um, and just so we talked about the three phases of uh of uh the agentic web. The very first phase is the foundations and within that the very first step is registry and index, right? What's the what's the addressing scheme for everybody when you know an agent you know comes into a city. Uh so one would be to create a DNS-like registry simply a lookup table saying hey John Smith this address you know Jane do this address and so on. Uh unfortunately that won't work very well because once you have millions maybe trillions of agents updating that and maintaining that will be very challenging. Today's DNS uh for website you know has less than a billion uh website and already is difficult. If you get a new account on GoDaddy, it takes a couple of hours before you can start using that. So imagine if you have trillions of these agents. So the MCP registry using this approach, you know, a straightup list of names to to the addresses. Uh the other approach would be a decentralized approach. Uh and many entities already using this. If you go to any agent store, this is the mechanism they're using, which is uh

[30:22] instead of having a centralized registry, you simply list the name of your agent and where to access it, its endpoint on your own website. So if you're Starbucks, then you just go to starbox.com.wellnown/agentlist. You can access all the Starbucks agents, you know, their customer agents, their booking agents, all those things there, which kind of makes sense. The problem with this model is that um you'll have incomplete discovery. So if there's an amazing agent that appears in Indonesia and if that website is not very popular, then you don't know where to hang your agent because your agent will never be discovered because some search a search engine has to scrape that particular website which could be a no-name website. That'll never happen, right? Only about 1% of of uh uh of websites by the way are updated on a on a regular basis, right? and not minute-to-minute basis either on a regular basis. So you have this incomplete discovery problem shown on the bottom left. Uh so you run into this problem of you might start decentralized because now everybody can create their agent list uh on their own websites but you have this risk of recentralization because somebody has to go and scrape all these websites to get a list of all these agents. Uh and then once they have done that they're going to become gatekeepers. you know they're going to become rent seekers and there'll be bias and there'll be censorship and all those problems. So there seems like no easy easy solution centralized versus decentralized and that's what the approach we'll talk about is this hybrid approach uh which we call you know a index or a quilt approach uh and the idea is that it's a lightweight interop link between all the heterogeneous agent registries maintained independently in neutral and distributed infrastructure right so if you use the analogy of city of Asians then companies that have tall 10 20 story buildings will not register the address of all the tenants into the city registry. They just say I'm at 100 Main Street and you are at 200 Broadway. That's it. And then if you have to

[32:24] access any of the tenants in that building, they to call go to 100 uh you know Main Street and then say, "Hey, does John Smith work here and so on." Uh but somebody like me, I just have a house in Cambridge. I might list myself saying Romeshar lives at, you know, uh two Broadway, right? So, so there's a f flexibility of those of us who want to be listed in the base registry uh can be out there but others like there are many agent store for example AWS is going to announce its uh agent marketplace on Wednesday there's no need for them to list all their agents in this you know central index so it allows every organization to maintain their own registries but the index is what allows the interop between them you know just as if I'm here and somebody's in Indonesia I can still make a phone call whether they're using GSM or CDMMA or they're on a different carrier, different brand of phone and so on. We can still talk to each other, right? So the interrupt happens because of the LDR and HDR that some of you might know. Those are records that the you know the cell phone towers have to keep so we can talk to each other. So that's the approach we're going to talk about a little bit more. So to do that the moment we say it's interrupt and neutrally maintained index, how do you keep it neutral? So we have about 15 universities top AI universities and faculty and scientists at this 15 organizations working together to maintain this index. So I really I'm really really humbled that all these amazing people are working with us uh to launch this. So we have APIs you know trusted things that doesn't mean the index that means the index is a single source of truth for interop but at the same time anybody can take a copy of it and create an enterprise version of that as well and we'll hear about a little bit more about that in a bit. So that's great for you know the existing types of agents but what about all the amazing work that's already going on uh in web 3. So uh Michael and Tricia we got together uh and we said while the index

[34:25] will support you know all kinds of uh other registry a special solution has to emerge for the web three agents as well. So I'm going to call up Michael uh and Tishv is here uh to just talk about how we're thinking about this over the next two months. So there are three phases proposal phase solution phase and build phase. Go ahead Michael. Yeah. So um you know all of you I think quite a number of the web3 community here uh and and you would be aware of the fact that I think when you think about some of the uh problems that Romesh is looking to address here the word trust comes up a lot right and I think that at the end of the day that's where web 3 excels the capacity to establish trust in a decentralized environment which is going to be very important for how we coordinate uh the maintenance of these registries and the the capacity to sort of coordinate across them. The problem as I see it from having been in the web 3 space I don't know if you know bit I've been in this thing for quite a while now 12 years is that ironically despite the capacity to uh you know develop these solutions for you know decentralized validation decentralized coordination what's happened is that we've all siloed ourselves as well right largely around tokens and the communities around those things so you end up with really an internet problem within web 3 even though the underlying technology is there so the purpose of All of this really is to is to think okay how do we all come together? How do we bring that expertise that common expertise we have around these validation systems these decentralized mechanisms of trust and bring that into an interoperable environment in which the uh web 3 all of these agents that are now being built on these web 3 platforms can be brought into this broader network this broader quilt uh um uh that we're talking about. So we're going to have uh today uh a number of presentations. We're going through a process of of scanning what's happening in the existing uh web 3 world. We're going to have some panels to start with and then we're moving into um a uh a series of solutions where people who

[36:26] have already distributed to us their ideas for how we would design this this web 3 quilt. Um and then ultimately we're having workshops to do this. Right. The idea is to come up with some sort of interoperability mechanism by which these registries and subregistries can resolve the problem that Romesh is talking about in terms of that discoverability and that capacity to find everybody and communicate across across those lines. We're calling it a quilt because we're trying to in the classic web 3 way get away from this idea of hierarchy, right? that it is somehow there's a top- down maintenance of that registry which of course brings us always back to the same centralized problem of trust. So a quilt in our mind represents this idea of knitting together a variety of solutions across common protocols and common mechanisms. >> Excellent. Okay. And you'll hear a lot more in our in about one hour. Um and another amazing things is that many companies have started contributing their engineers and and managers and compute uh for for project Nanda creating the internet of of AI agents. Uh we're going to in a few minutes hear from uh Robert Bench uh CEO of Radius and they've actually offered 10 fellowships. So we had a call and we had you know many many applications. So we're going to announce the candidates uh in a few days and other companies are also coming in. So Tresata which is one of the dynamic companies uh thinking about data and AI and AI agents uh that have just launched a new call for fellows. So if you are a developer and you want to participate as an open source contributor on a somewhat full-time basis u you know just just join uh use the QR code. We'll have more information about this tomorrow as well. And if you're a company that wants to you know use this mechanism to surface new talent because there is no talent out there in the agentic web. It's a very new space. Uh so this is a great way to also attract talent and I'm sure Richard many of these 10 people will eventually join your company full-time I'm guessing uh uh and so on right so it's it's a great ecosystem uh to do

[38:27] that so uh so the agenda is available for you uh in the Luma page uh but roughly in the morning we have some great presentations uh from about 10:30 to 1 p.m. we're going to focus on uh on on in the morning we're going to focus on the index 10:30 to 1 p.m. We're going to talk about the web 3 quilt. Uh in the afternoon, we'll have some amazing speakers and then we'll have, you know, hands-on sessions. And in the evening from 7 to 10 in this room, we'll do, you know, a a hack. So, bring your laptops, you know, bring your questions and you can walk away even if you have no major experience. Um walk away with building your own agents or if you have a company launching an agent for yourself in matter of minutes because all the SDKs and so on are there. uh and tomorrow uh again we'll be spending a lot of time thinking about uh you know the the research and technical road map of these things. We'll have some again some really great speakers, some really good uh uh corporate leaders. Um we will have uh investors even today and tomorrow we have a lot of projects and startup innovations uh being being presented here. So two very packed days. So to summarize uh we encourage you to join the MIT project uh as a member uh we also have a nonprofit uh you know foundation for agentic web that we'll talk about over the next couple of days uh do participate in the web3 uh quilt RFP even if you're not in the web 3 space you know this is a very intellectual conversation uh for a white paper and implementation uh there are fellowships from radius and trussetta that you can apply but if you're a company that wants to launch more fellowships we can get the word out uh and then please try to join the breakout groups today and the working group tomorrow. The breakout groups are open to everybody uh but the working groups are by invitation only. So you'll get an email later today uh about your your working group because it's mainly for uh for our members or people who are about to be members in that sense. Um so with that I'm going to um u you know thank you for coming here. Uh this is going to

[40:29] be exciting two days.
