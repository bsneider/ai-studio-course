[0:05] [Music] so ladies and gentlemen he gave the graduation address at unc that's who's next professor ramesh rasker uh he was one of the fastest in the history of mit to get tenure he was in industry he had a bunch of patents he invented the pico projector when he came here he did research to see around corners he worked at uh at google x he for two years he worked at apple to help them with their security strategy roadmap he worked at microsoft and he worked at facebook helping them with their health stuff uh the big companies ask him to come in and be the x factor be the the creative innovator uh but i think his biggest legacy is uh his teams that he's attracted here and what they've gone on to do i think one company was just bought by alphabet and he's just crushing it uh and he's just getting started and he really believes in the potential of of what's in front of us ladies and gentlemen professor ramesh rasker thank you john and also i'm a professor here at the mit media lab so welcome to mit media lab all right uh hello everyone so let's talk about web 3 and decentralized ai or deck ai now my cousin amy who's in her 50s is diabetic has a family history of lung cancer recently she had chest x-rays and started complaining about chest pain and she's just not happy with the treatment she's getting in her rural hospital and i wondered you know can i just bet can i just bid thousand dollars on web 3 so that somehow you know the global hive

[2:06] can actually give me a solution of what's the best treatment for for aiming so i think they have an opportunity to take web 3 from a payment economy to serve the siloed data and ai economy now if i have to do this for amy today you know the answer is somewhere out there the solution is in some hospital there's some collective intelligence that can actually already solve this problem we don't have to invent a whole new drug so the way it would be done is there'll be research grants written you know people aggregate all the data from multiple hospitals they'll try to find patterns they'll train some models they'll publish them at some point it'll become a protocol and eventually emmy will get the guidance very slow inefficient coordination that's required to to make it happen now if magically if i had a god's eye view i would just tell all the hospitals in the world to just give me the data i will train the best machine learning algorithms i would even take my thousand dollars and you know correspondingly uh distribute them to the people who are helping me uh and then bring back the suggestions to amy right and without web 3 as a platform for decentralization can web 3 solve this problem i mean come on i mean all of us care about our loved ones and we are using the power of web3 to solve a narrow sliver of societal problems but i think all of us deserve to have much better solutions now the reality of the god's eye view is that the hospitals are unwilling to share their data because of you know regulations or trade secrets or privacy you know even if you can get all these petabytes of data we don't know how to train the models uh you know how do we do this remotely how do we choose the best one and if you want to revive reward the corresponding hospitals who actually eventually help you you know how do you figure out how to split those thousand dollars that i have um and think that things are happening in a

[4:09] very invisible manner and even if can if i bring the information back to back to amy it's not going to look like expedia or something where i can just show all the options uh that she can choose choose between so clearly we have to augment the web 3 nodes interesting way beyond mining and verification and validation and storage and so on and we have to think about other nodes we may have to add to web3 that includes ai services hospitals health exchange platforms and of course the consumers now you have seen those slides for web one and web twos read and write and web three is about own but i would like you to think about this progression in a slightly different way i would say that we have done a very good job of exploiting the data to connect you know different uh disjointed points over time but we haven't done as good a job in actually extracting understanding and intelligence from these trends and only now as we start thinking about cooperation we need to start worrying about what does it mean to infer what does it mean to understand what does mean to actually extract you know that extra bit of intelligence the collective intelligence that's out there so i think the intersection of web 3 and decentralized ai is really poised to allow us to do this self orchestration in a very decentralized manner so we have the same problems here if you have to help amy aggregate data mine the data reward the participants and guide amy now many components of f3 already exist you know through pseudo-anonymity for aggregation leisure tech that allows us to orchestrate uh incentive and game theory that encourages others to participate and still get you know fair compensation and their exchanges like coinbase and and and ftx and others you know that guide us uh of how to uh for decision support i'm going to talk about four corresponding technologies that we must introduce to take web 3 into the world of decentralized ai and right here at mit

[6:10] mit media lab there's research going on in all these directions so i encourage you to go to our website about many many papers that are being written up you know many think tanks that are discussing these ideas and hopefully after the session we can do a deep dive as well so let me go through these four augmentations one by one the first one is privacy tech instead of the pseudo-anonymity that's possible today in web 3 we want true no peak privacy and what is that i mean if you think about google maps we willingly give away our gps locations without a sense of privacy and we get great utility out of it because google can deliver traffic density and turn water navigation for that on the other hand when it comes to health data it gets siloed because of regulations and privacy constraints and we're simply not able to recover the best treatments for amy so this is very frustrating right so the kind of new algorithms that are emerging in distributed and private ai are the ones that really matter uh so a lot of work here we do at the mit media lab is called split learning splitlearning.mit.edu that's trying to solve this problem so let me give you a flavor of how this works right now when you think about privacy the bottom left the the yellow circle is how we think about privacy a little bit of data about each of us and are we able to protect that in certain way but in reality privacy also plays a role at organizational level and even you know at nation scale and when we think about the organizational level privacy could mean because of regulation or because of trade secrets you cannot share that data you know those chest x-rays we talked about for amy the reason some nations may not want to give it is because they're doing particular kind of research or they're worried about you know other nations figuring out you know how particular individuals in that country are suffering from particular certain kinds of disease or organizations like pharma companies or insurance players you know might be

[8:12] worried about that there is a uh there is a data breach or there could be a a rogue employee who could be leaking this data for many reasons data cannot be shared and it remains siloed and of course at nation scale you know the chinese and the koreans couldn't share with us the chest x-rays at the beginning of kovid because for them it was also a national security issue although it would have been nice to create a machine learning algorithm that looks looks at a chest x-ray and can quickly figure out what kind of covert symptoms this patient is going to have very soon so that's kind of how we should think about privacy not just individual privacy but at organizational and nation skill what about the relationship with confidentiality and anonymity now confidentiality means we're just protecting the identity but we are not protecting the data right so that's not good enough that's not privacy then you can upgrade that to pseudo-anonymity which we see on web3 but unfortunately you'll have a persistent identifier and using overlapping data sets you can recover that you can do slightly better by using non-persistent identifiers which is anonymity that you would see in a lot of apple products but that's also not enough because you still have other overlapping activities that allows you to create a fingerprint um and create at least great cohorts the kind of privacy we are talking about here that we need for web3 and decentralized ai is a private server called no peak so please take a look there's a lot of documentation online about what no peak privacy uh could look like so again we're not talking about just protecting identity but we're also talking about protecting data that means those chest x-rays that the hospitals have to provide they never should have to share them and if they share them in some particular form nobody should nobody should be able to reconstruct those chest x-rays given by those hospitals so there are four common ways people have thought about adding privacy as i said anonymization is no privacy at all um there are techniques like differential privacy that would add some noise to the

[10:12] data and then for the best kind of privacy is by using encryption techniques like homophobic encryption the challenge with these methods is that if you look at the other axis which is the utility of this data is that most of these methods end up reducing the way you can exploit this data for example the chest x-rays and the treatment plans to create meaningful machine learning models so two techniques have emerged over the last five years one is called federated learning invented by google and the other one is called split learning invented by our group here at mit and this kind of techniques i'm really excited about because they allow you to take data for decentralized operations like decentralized ai and the key idea behind these techniques is that you just want to share wisdom without sharing the raw data so instead of sharing the chest x-rays and treatment plans you can just create the wisdom of what a solution for amy could look like the second challenge is how can we upgrade the ledger tech um not just for verifying transactions but creating verifiable decentralized ai so nodes can do hashing but the task is going to shift to training and the proof of work now shifts to verifying the ai task itself which is giving some providence on what type of data was used which x-rays were used what treatment plans were used did you use the right kind of data with right kind of diversity and did you have that in the right kind of test accuracy all of this has to be done without looking at the raw data without calling up the hospital or demanding to see the raw data for consensus the nodes had to figure out you know how we figure the best algorithm that's emerging either from a given hospital i or by a consortium of hospitals to help amy and then finally instead of publishing we'll have to figure out how we package this dot this data so it's not just verifiable on a blockchain but it's also interpretable when amy has to figure out which treatment is best for her

[12:14] the third challenge is the the incentives now blockchain and web 3 had completely revolutionized how we can solve the cold start problem how can we use tokenization to get many players to participate in a system and how we can fairly compensate them now we have to go well beyond that because not just about transactions but we're talking about a lot of personal data treatment plans chest x-rays you know health records and so on so the the problem in a lot of these cases is to create a new form of a market which i would like to call either a data market or a model market uh in this case the buyer might have some existing data i might have the treatment plans and chest x-rays for amy and a few other people and i would like to go go outside and query hundreds of hospitals out there saying i want to find out from you if you have relevant data for me but how to perform that operation without exchanging raw data one way to solve the problem is to do a mathematical operation which is called correlation and the correlation is very high then i know without looking at the raw data that this may be actually very very relevant for me and also not redundant so it's always a trade-off between data that's relevant but not redundant and from that i had to create you know a new valuation function that says if thousands of hospitals participated and they responded to my query how would i take my thousand dollars and distribute amongst them those are completely new forms of algorithm so the key challenge here is how can we estimate the dollar value of the data that you cannot see and then finally when all these queries and responses come back you know much like on coinbase or ftx you know you those platforms allow you to deal with problems such as you know discovery visualization and decision support uh you need a way for amy and me and you know all of us who are trying to help our loved ones to take that data

[14:15] and be able to figure out whether it's interpretable uh run some what-if scenarios and at the same time figure out if they fit with particular parameters that could be aggressive treatment not aggressive treatment you have to travel for it or not so all these solutions have been packaged in a way that they are actually interpretable now there are many risks i mean we just know about you know the risks of believing in algorithmic social orchestration like the one i'm talking about those of you you know who made a lot of money on luna and usd will know that now bad actors in this case are invisible because their data is invisible to us the only thing we know is the wisdom that was extracted from the data so the bad actors can actually introduce a lot of adverse serial data uh so that's the challenge and they might do it because they want to just resell you know useless data or they might want to actually create harm and as i said earlier the trade-off between the data that you want is very relevant at the same time not redundant is a big question now it's obvious to all of us that this type of societal orchestration where the data is invisible and we need a god's eye view to solve it is not limited to just you know health queries uh whether it's you know dealing with transportation supply chain you know civic planning imagine if systems can tap into our smartphones and extract our gps trail in a completely privacy preserving way computational privacy not just design and use that for solving social problems such as civic planning or taxation issues uh or even thinking about different types of climate change policies and imagine for supply chain if suppliers and and consumers can allow us to run what-if scenarios by again allowing us to tap into their ledgers so all these things are possible if you can build the building blocks required

[16:16] to take web 3 in the world of decentralized ai and if you have to create this god's eye view to really help you know our loved ones uh for their health i think the talent is in this room so let's do it together thank you [Applause] you
