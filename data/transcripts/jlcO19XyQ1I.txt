[0:01] Uh today we are talking about the internet of AI. Now if you think about the world of computing, the history of computing, which one is more important? Is it the personal computer or the internet that connected all those computers? Right? So it's the internet. So right now we're in the same moment. Is it about AI or is it about the internet of AI that's going to be more impactful? But we're going through these different phases. Today we are kind of in the mainframe phase of AI just like the DOSs. We write commands and get answers from you know a chatbot. Uh then there's internet which is you know all these agents stay within a wall garden uh and they know each other. But then from there we have to go to internet a really scary place where we go to navigate and discover things on our own for our agents. That's like decentralized AI but from internet to the worldwide web because internet was about connecting computers and the worldwide web is about connecting people and that's where you know Nanda is going and Nanda stands for network agents AI in a decentralized architecture. So imagine a birthday scenario for my daughter's birthday coming up and uh it's kind of scary to go plan all these things and imagine if I could instead of going to a store I can just talk to the shopping agent saying hey the bakery my shopping list you know Target my party store do something for me and all these agents can go and figure out you know what's really required and negotiate on my behalf maybe suck up all the photos from my phone to see whether my daughter likes Taylor Swift or she like Star Wars. I have a 3D model of my house and I can see a visualization from all those products of how the birthday party will look like and I can just select, you know, $200, $500, $1,000 and just click one and all the supplies show up the next day, right? Of course, this has a lot of issues. Who the hell is going to give all the photos to a company? So there you have to solve privacy. There has to be markets that are willing to

[2:02] tell me how this works. There's intelligence that I'm going to get served. There's verifiability. there could be a lot of bad actors and I need some kind of a new UX a browser is not going to do this. So you know we have been on this journey for the last 10 years uh at MIT uh solving the privacy tech creating AutoML AI that designs better AI new types of knowledge markets for data markets you know intelligence markets and decentralized solutions and so the question is if this AI agents are going to communicate and navigate and socialize and learn earn and transact on our behalf how are they all going to do this you know how does this look like the DNS the browsers the HTTP and HTML of the web. The exciting part is companies like Enthropic and Google have recently re recently released uh protocols for communication. It's like the TCP IP of, you know, two machines talking to each other, which is great, but we had to go well beyond just communication and solve problems like discovery and search and authentication and trace. And that's what Nanda is about. It's an architecture that will support many protocols including MCP and A2A but each of those protocols could have dozens of different implementations. So that's the beauty of thinking like an architecture here and so it requires all those things just like you know a website gets certificates uh there coupons like web logs there's registration all these things that we have in the web world also map to the agent world but it'll be a mistake to say that agents will behave just like the web pages behave because in the 90s we could have said oh web pages will behave just like fax machines. Um so we have it you know we have the Nanda registry like a DNS registry and I'm delighted to announce that 15 AI universities are on this node already. Isn't that amazing? Remember the very first nodes on the internet were UCSB, UCLA uh and

[4:02] SRRI and MIT came just right after that. So, we're very delighted that we're including UCLA uh in this one as well. And many companies, many startups already have their services on this open-source open architecture platform. Uh and you you can go play it out at nanda.mmit.edu. Uh and let me show you a quick video uh of uh of how this works. What you will see in the video is that to to you know design this uh to organize this birthday party I can connect to various services my Spotify list you know the bakery shop you know I can add all the services that I want and they might be charging me they might charge me like 50 cents for the query you know or to do some intelligence on their sites can go to all these servers and add them if there's a new shop in your neighborhood that shows up you can just add them to your services and this looks like a chat GPT or a cloud like interface for today. uh you can play with it and then you can go and say hey are these real stores you know there shouldn't be bad actors on this thing and then you can say hey you know what's the weather just to make sure everything is working what tools do you have say oh I can you know I can make cakes for you I can design songs for you I can send party supplies for you uh and so on and all the services will be out there working for you and just for a few dollars just like you are willing to pay a few dollars to get you know the best airline tickets because you know the you are paying for it or order from Uber, some of those prices are included. Uh all the services will be out there. So in the finally I can say for my for my daughter's birthday hey you know do you have you know a chocolate cake and can you deliver that by tomorrow and it goes to the nanda agent of the bakery shop and talks in real time and there's a small intelligent module working on the bakery shops server as well and they can look at their inventory and their list and come back with an answer right so all the orchestration around your life can be done this way of course we are taking a low stake scenario like a birthday party but imagine doing the same thing for you know your health

[6:04] condition you know you have to go and search across all these pages now all the services are coming at you or think about supply chain and and so on so we are very delighted that we are we're launching this open source and if your company and if your startups can get up and running in a matter of minutes with whatever existing software you have and add the nunda modules on top of it so you know you can host a registry you can connect your apps or API or you can contribute to the open source and and join this movement. We have many many partners uh already with us and if the agentic web in the future looks more like this open vibrant worldwide web as opposed to today's app stores and play stores. This will be the moment we will remember. Thank you Romesh. That's an incredibly impressive and ambitious outline that you've just given us. I know you have some experience working in big tech and I'm sure Google and Apple and others Meta are thinking about these things. How can a project from MIT come along and outrun what they may want to do to rein in the open internet of AI? In fact, everybody's craving for something that's open and vibrant. You know I've myself have run AI teams at Facebook, Google, Apple. Uh I've run teams there myself uh in addition to many startups and MIT has a history. We are deeply inspired by Tim Berners Lee and the worldwide web consortium right here at MIT. You know that really showed how we can create this open vibrant web uh from early 90s to about 95 and that really unleashed trillions of dollars of uh of economic value. uh and people like Nil Gashanfield and Sanja Sharma other professors started the auto ID center for all the barcodes all the RFID you know all kinds of uh so MIT has a deep history in starting something ambitious but being very open and very inclusive

[8:06] and the fact that 15 top 15 AI universities are already working with us with many companies uh hopefully there's good you know enough of a momentum here that we can overcome the cold start problem the other piece of it that's fascinating to me you mentioned very quickly that the agents could charge prices, maybe even there'll be competing agents charging different prices. Tell me a little about how the business model is supposed to work. Uh if everybody is plugging in their agents, uh lots of cake vendors are in there. Yeah. So, so imagine, you know, I have some health condition and I'm looking for information. You know, there could be a research agent that goes and does research for me. There could be, you know, a bunch of clinicians. They're running their agents, getting some services. There could be hotels that could say, "Hey, if you're going for surgery, you can stay with us." So this could be very high stakes scenarios and you could imagine many this is a wisdom economy not just a transaction economy not just an information economy but wisdom economy if these agents out there are willing to provide me service they could be competing for my service and my agent uh could be negotiating in real time saying hey you're charging me 50 cents for the service this other one is charging me $2 for the service but you seem to have better reputation uh and and I'm going to go with you so we can imagine you know billions and trillions of dollars of value being created when each one of us has the ability to create our own AI agents. Every shop, every individual, every organization can train and deploy their own agents. And I think that's the analogy with the websites. Uh you know that uh and I think that's we really want to use Nanda as a platform to build this the commerce backbone. So, as you're explaining it, the reputation and past actions of the different agents is going to be very important. When I go to a new city and I need a coffee place, I pull up Google Maps. I see all the ratings that all the users have put in and I know, you know, don't go to the 3.2, go to the 4.7. How will the agents know to navigate just between price and reputation? Where will all that information come from? Yeah, if you if you think about the internet stack, we

[10:07] left things like Yelp and so on, you know, in the application layer because it includes the human messiness of scoring. But because this is agent to agent communication, a lot of the interactions were algorithmic uh and they could be, you know, solved with some cryptographic puzzles and smart contracts and so on. So things like reputation and KYA know your agent can actually be uh you know nicely ported to the infrastructure layer at as part of the architecture of building this internet of AI agents. Uh so that's the beauty of it. It's like your social security number and your credit score is a common good you know and because of your credit score you can go and buy a house. Uh so I think the the agentic reputation will look more like your credit score than something like Yelp where is some human messiness. Okay, we just have a few seconds left but tell me a little about your vision five years from now. Uh how will I be able to uh use this system if it's if it goes as you expect? I mean, you know, each of us use, you know, tens of apps today, but it's it's a mess, you know, because it's very, you know, walled gardens. The apps don't even talk to each other. I cannot create a team of apps to work for me. Uh, but you'll be able to create teams of agents, you know, you know, Bob's agents that are out there and working on your behalf. Uh, and they will learn, they will earn, you know, they will transact. And at some point, you say, "Hey, all Bob's agents are not doing well." you send agents to an Asian school. They'll come back at some point and you know I have I have a teenage daughter. So, you know, like it's a difficult conversation. So, my agent can go talk to her agent and say, "You know what? Let's just let's just let's just figure this out and if you get an A+ in math, we can take your take that trip to Spain you're talking about." I hope my team of agents is more like the Celtics and less like the Red Sox. But we'll have to leave it there. Thank you. Thank you.
